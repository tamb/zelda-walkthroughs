# Cache Issues Solution

## Problem
The app was experiencing 404 errors for JavaScript and CSS files due to browser cache issues and hardcoded URLs that didn't match the actual build output.

## Root Causes

1. **Browser Cache**: Old cached resources with incorrect paths
2. **Service Worker Cache**: Old service worker was caching incorrect URLs
3. **Build Cache**: Build system was using cached files with old hashes

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Service Worker**
- Updated cache version from `v1` to `v2` to force cache refresh
- Added aggressive cache clearing on service worker activation
- Improved cache management for GitHub Pages deployment

### 2. **Cache Clearing Script**
Created `scripts/clear-cache.js` that:
- Clears the dist directory completely
- Removes build cache from node_modules
- Ensures fresh build every time

### 3. **Clean Build Command**
Added `npm run build:clean` that:
- Runs cache clearing script first
- Then builds with fresh cache
- Ensures no stale files are used

### 4. **URL Verification**
All generated URLs now correctly use GitHub Pages prefix:
- âœ… CSS: `/zelda-walkthroughs/static/css/index.8646d976.css`
- âœ… JS: `/zelda-walkthroughs/static/js/index.d8e63e9d.js`
- âœ… All assets properly prefixed

## How to Use

### **For Development**
```bash
# Clean build (recommended)
npm run build:clean

# Regular build
npm run build:gh-pages
```

### **For Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy with clean build
npm run build:clean
npm run deploy
```

### **For Browser Cache Issues**
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache manually
3. Use incognito/private mode for testing

## Files Modified

- `public/sw.js` - Updated cache version and clearing logic
- `scripts/clear-cache.js` - New cache clearing script
- `package.json` - Added clean build command

## Verification

After running `npm run build:clean`, verify:
- âœ… No 404 errors in browser console
- âœ… All resources load with correct paths
- âœ… Service worker registers successfully
- âœ… PWA installation works

## Prevention

To prevent future cache issues:
1. Always use `npm run build:clean` for deployments
2. Update service worker cache version when making changes
3. Test in incognito mode to avoid browser cache issues
4. Use the refresh button in the PWA to clear cache

The cache issues should now be completely resolved! ðŸŽ‰
