# PWA Refresh Feature

## Overview
The refresh button allows users to manually update the app and download the latest version while preserving their progress and settings stored in IndexedDB/localforage.

## How It Works

### 1. **Cache Clearing**
- Clears all service worker caches
- Forces download of fresh files from the server
- Preserves IndexedDB/localforage data (user progress, settings)

### 2. **Service Worker Update**
- Forces the service worker to update
- Re-registers the service worker if needed
- Ensures the latest version is active

### 3. **User Experience**
- Only visible when the app is running as a PWA (installed)
- Shows confirmation dialog before clearing cache
- Displays loading state during refresh
- Automatically reloads the page after clearing cache

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `src/components/Navbar/Navbar.tsx` - Added refresh button to navigation
- `src/utils/cacheUtils.ts` - Cache clearing utilities
- `public/sw.js` - Enhanced service worker with update handling

### Key Functions
- `clearAppCache()` - Main function that clears cache and updates service worker
- `isPWA()` - Detects if app is running as installed PWA
- `confirmCacheRefresh()` - Shows confirmation dialog

## Usage
1. Install the PWA
2. Look for the "ðŸ”„ Refresh" button in the navigation (only visible in PWA mode)
3. Click the button and confirm the action
4. The app will clear its cache and download the latest version

## Benefits
- **Manual Updates**: Users can get updates without waiting for automatic service worker updates
- **Data Preservation**: User progress and settings are preserved
- **Fresh Content**: Ensures users get the latest content and bug fixes
- **Offline Capability**: App remains functional offline after refresh

## Browser Support
- Works in all modern browsers that support PWAs
- Requires service worker support
- Uses standard Cache API and Service Worker API
