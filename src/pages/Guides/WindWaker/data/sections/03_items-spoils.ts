3.         Items/Spoils
===============================================================================

As with every Zelda game, you slowly build an arsenal of various weapons and 
items as you complete tasks and clear dungeons. Here is a brief description of 
things you will come across:

ALL PURPOSE BAIT: Purchased from Beedle or via the Knuckle Hand-me-down tuner. 
When thrown on the ground, animals and even some enemies swarm to it to eat it. 
VERY useful in taking pictures for the Gallery. It is also used when near the 
Merman to get him to fill in your sea chart. If used on the Merman a second 
time, he plays a little target game with you.

BAGS: There are three bags in the game, each is obtained in different ways. You 
win the spoils bag from Niko while you are sailing to the Forsaken Fortress the 
first time. It holds various items dropped by enemies. The bait bag is bought 
from Beedle, and it holds all purpose bait and hyoi pears. The delivery bag is 
given to you by Quill on Dragon Roost Island, and it holds letters and other 
miscellaneous things you pick up. Each bag can hold 8 "sets" of items.

BOMBS: Won from Niko in between dungeon #2 and dungeon #3. Bombs, uh, blow 
things up. They are also used as ammo for a cannon when on King. When you first 
get them, you can hold 30 max, but you can upgrade to 99 bombs max.

BOOMERANG: Won in dungeon #2. Aside from the sword, the most useful item in the 
game, hands down. Use it to stun enemies, pick up items, hit switches, or cut 
strings. I cannot overstate how useful the boomerang is.

BOTTLE: You can hold up to four. Each is found in a different place. Medli gives 
you the first right outside of dungeon #1.

DEKU LEAF: You get this from the Great Deku Tree right before the second 
dungeon. It is most useful as a sort of glider/parachute, though using it that 
way consumes magic. You can also use it to blow a gust of wind, which is also 
useful in various situations.

GRAPPLING HOOK: Won in the first dungeon. It can be attached to certain poles so 
you can either swing or climb, depending on what is needed. If used on King, it 
serves as a crane. Use it to pull treasure out of the sea.

HERO'S BOW: Won in dungeon #3. You start with regular arrows, useful as weapons 
or to hit switches (either from afar or certain eye switches that only arrows 
can trigger). Later, you get fire and ice arrows, used to burn/melt or freeze 
things/enemies, respectively. Near the end of the game, you win light arrows, 
the most powerful weapon in the game. Any non-boss dies in one shot. Fire, ice, 
and light arrows cost magic to use, and you have a limited supply of arrows in 
general (that starts at 30 but can be upgraded to 99).

HERO'S CHARM: Given to you by Miss Marie after you give her 50 joy pendants. It 
is on the quest menu, under the shield and whatnot. If equipped, you see a life 
bar for enemies (and Link is wearing a mask, but that is purely cosmetic).

HOOKSHOT: Won in dungeon #5. Used to pull one thing to another. You can pull 
yourself to a ledge or a tree or lamp, OR you can pull enemies, items, or even 
statues to you.

HYOI PEARS: Bought from Beedle. When used, you place it on your head. If there 
are any seagulls in range, one will swoop down and take it off your head. You 
then have control of the bird until you either cancel it or the bird is hit by 
an enemy.

IRON BOOTS: Found inside Ice Island. When worn, they weigh you down, which means 
wind can't blow you. They're also used to weigh down certain spring platforms 
and switches, and, when used with the hookshot, lets you pull Maoi heads off the 
wall.

MAGIC ARMOR: Given to you by Iceman (Zunari) after you get two more products for 
his shop (sea flower and exotic flower). It protects you from a lot of attacks 
(and from floormasters).

PICTO BOX: Found in Tingle's cell. It is used to take pictures. Easy enough. If 
you complete several tasks for Lenzo, he will upgrade it to a Deluxe Picto Box, 
which takes color pictures. 

POWER BRACELETS: Found inside the volcano. They let you pick up huge boulders. 
That's about it.

SAIL: Purchased on Windfall Island. You use it to sail King. That's it.

SHIELD: The wooden shield is given to you by your grandmother as you leave to 
find Aryll. It is used to block projectiles and can even bounce some back. In 
dungeon #4, the shield is upgraded to the mirror shield. In addition to normal 
uses for a shield, it can also reflect light.

SKULL HAMMER: Won the second time you go to the Forsaken Fortress. It is used to 
pound things. It's a hammer.

SWORD: Used to cut things (and bounce certain projectiles back at enemies). 
There are four levels to the sword:
     Level 1: The wooden sword. Given to you by Orca on Outset Island before 
              you rescue Tetra. The weakest sword.
     Level 2: The Master Sword. Pulled from a stone in Hyrule Castle. 
     Level 3: A powered up Master Sword. Won at the end of dungeon #4.
     Level 4: A fully powered up Master Sword. Won at the end of dungeon #5.

TELESCOPE: Given to you by Aryll in the first 5 minutes of the game. You use it 
to see things that are far away.

TINGLE TUNER: Tingle gives this to you when you rescue him from his cell. It can 
only be used in areas with maps (you don't actually have to have the map, 
though), and it "summons" Tingle to help you. Basically, it allows your GBA to 
be used to do various things. There is a more detailed section later in the 
guide.

WIND WAKER: King gives it to you when you land at Dragon Roost Island. Like the 
ocarina from Ocarina of Time, it is used to conduct songs. The Wind Waker itself 
doesn't do much, but the songs you play have various effects.

                                  - SPOILS -

First, ALL spoils can be sold to Beedle if you need some cash. Secondly, the 
easiest way to get them by far is to use the grappling hook. See the next 
section for details. I list the easiest places to get each spoil, but you can 
find them other places too (even in chests sometimes).

BLUE CHU JELLY: Won from blue chuchus. You give them to Doc Bandam, the potion 
master on Windfall Island, and he will make you blue potion.

BOKO BABA SEED: Won from boko babas. You can give them to Hollo, the korok who 
lives in a cave near the Great Deku Tree (i.e., it's in the same room, look 
around). He will give you blue potion for every 4 seeds you give him.

GOLDEN FEATHER: Won from peahats and kargarocs. Hoskit, who is on Dragon Roost 
Island, will buy them from you.

GREEN CHU JELLY: Won from green chuchus. You give them to Doc Bandam, the potion 
master on Windfall Island, and he will make you green potion.

JOY PENDANT: Shaped like a butterfly, you win them from bokoblins. THE most 
important spoil in the game. You give them to Miss Marie, the teacher on 
Windfall Island, and various things happen (detailed in the walkthru).

KNIGHT'S CREST: Won from darknuts. Orca loves these, and if you bring him 10, he 
will teach you a special sword technique (an upgraded spin attack).

RED CHU JELLY: Won from red chuchus. You give them to Doc Bandam, the potion 
master on Windfall Island, and he will make you red potion.

SKULL NECKLACE: Won from moblins. You give them to a pirate near the bomb shop 
on Windfall Island and he plays a mini-game with you.`,
