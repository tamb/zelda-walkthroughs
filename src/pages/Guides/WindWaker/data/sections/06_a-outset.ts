A) OUTSET (FROM OUTSET ISLAND)
---------------------------------------------------------------

Now the game really begins. You're asleep at the top of a watchtower when your 
little sister, Aryll, comes to wake you up. She tells you to go see your 
grandmother (and points out her house to you), so we'd better not keep her 
waiting. Head down the ladder, turn west, and jump into the water. Swim over to 
the shore directly in front of you, and head west along the beach until you see 
a path. Turn south and follow the path. Turn right at the first fork, right at 
the second fork, and go into the first house on your right.

As soon as you enter, take a step forward and hit L. Get used to this, you'll 
need to do it in almost every house you enter to readjust the camera. There's a 
ladder to the left, climb it and approach the little old lady (your 
grandmother). A scene will begin where she hands you some snazzy new threads. 
After all, what kind of Link wouldn't have his trademark green tunic and hat? 
After you put them on (it's done automatically, don't worry), she tells you to 
go show Aryll. So, leave the house and head back to the little watchtower (head 
east down the path, take the first left, a right, go across the bridge, up the 
path directly in front of you, take a left at the fork, and head down the dock 
to the ladder).  Approach Aryll for another scene. She is so thoroughly 
impressed by your new duds that she gives you a telescope (it's actually a 
birthday present, but I like my way better). Not bad, about 3 minutes into the 
game and we've already gotten two items.

As soon as the scene is over, press start and equip the telescope to a button 
(it doesn't matter which, Y is what I use). Take a few steps forward (so you're 
next to sis at the railing) and use it. Tilt the C-stick up until the little 
zoom meter says 4X, then pan down a little. It should stop on a birdman at the 
mailbox. Zoom in all the way, and watch as he looks around and then takes 
flight. Zoom back out to 4X and pan straight up to the sky. You'll stop at a 
giant bird and another event will happen. He's holding a girl until he gets 
clocked in the face by a cannonball and drops her into the forest. You're a 
hero, right? Let's go save her!

Oh, wait. Heroes usually have swords, don't they? Let's go get us one. Down the 
ladder again, turn west, into the water and to the shore just like before. Take 
the same path, but this time when you reach the first fork, go straight into the 
house in front of you, ignoring the little old man (Sturgeon) who calls at you 
when you approach (use the door directly below the aforementioned little old 
man). There's an old man inside the house, this one not so little and with a bit 
of a gut (Orca). Talk to him. He'll sense that you're anxious about something 
and ask if you need some sword training. He will briefly describe what he wants 
you to do. We'll take this in steps, as he does.

1) Hit him once with the B button.
2) Hit him 8 more times with the B button.
3) Hold down L and hit him with B.
4) Repeat 8 more times.
5) Hold down L, hold up, and hit him with B.
6) You guessed it, 8 more times.
7) Hold down B until your spin attack is charged (Link should be holding his 
sword behind him) and hit him with that.
8) Do it again, only once this time.
9) This technique is IMPORTANT! Pay attention! Hold down L to lock onto the old 
man. Wait until he is about to attack you. Your sword will turn green and you 
will hear a little noise. Hit A. You will do a counter attack. Learn it. Live 
it. Love it.
10) Just to make sure you understand, do it again.
11) Use L to lock on, then hit A (not waiting for the green this time) to do a 
jumping slash.
12) Do it one more time.

Training is now over, and you go back to a dialogue. Basically, he says 
something in traditional Zelda old man fashion, like "Master using it and you 
can have this," and he gives you a sword. Huzzah! Turn around and leave the 
house. Use the L button to reposition the camera again (from now on, do that any 
time it is not facing the same direction as Link is). Head straight ahead, back 
onto the path (which is actually the second little patch of brown, the first 
being some dirt in front of the house, and turn right. Down the path, across the 
bridge, back onto the path, and turn right at the fork this time. Follow the 
path up the hill and around the bend to some trees. Cut them down with your 
sword and keep going. Turn left at the fork and go across the rope bridge and 
into the cave there (run as you approach the hole in the bridge to jump across 
it).

You're in the forest, and look, there's the girl we're looking for. Go forward, 
hugging the right wall so you go up the little path there. Jump down from the 
little ledge and continue forward to our first enemy, a bokoblin! This guy is a 
piece of cake, but he still takes a few hits. Just lock onto him and mash the B 
button. If he falls down, let him get back up and then hit him again. He'll die. 
Climb onto the stump you see (it was next to the bokoblin), and jump from it 
onto the ledge in front of it. Head forward and you'll see a fallen tree trunk. 
It's lying remarkably like a ramp, so let's use it as one. Up and over, and 
after a few steps, some birds (kargarocs) will drop two more bokoblins. Take 
them one at a time, the same way as the first. If you're lucky, you might even 
hit both with one attack. If so, good for you. Have a cookie.

After they're dead, the girl falls from her precarious perch, and you 
automatically run over to talk to her. Her name is Tetra, and she's a pirate. 
She's actually the leader of the pirates, despite being the same age as Link. 
While you're talking, one of her crew runs up. More talking, and everyone leaves 
the forest. Back at the rope bridge, Aryll is waiting for her hero big brother. 
She runs over to congratulate you, only to be snatched by the giant bird. Link 
is apparently a moron, as he runs right off the cliff while chasing the bird. 
Luckily, Tetra catches you and pulls you back to safety. Cut down to the beach, 
where Tetra and one of the crew are waiting. They're about to leave and you ask 
to come along. Tetra says no way, but the birdman (Quill, a mailman) shows up 
and lays a major guilt trip on her. Reluctantly, Tetra agrees to give you a lift 
to get your sister if you can find a shield. But, before you can leave, you'd 
better go tell your grandmother, so head back to her house (you should know the 
way). Before you talk to her, head up the ladder. The shield from the wall is 
gone. Now go talk to granny and she'll give it to you. You can use it in battle 
by pressing R while you have a weapon drawn.

Before you leave the island, you might want to pick up some rupees. There are a 
total of three pigs running around (2 near Granny's house, and one near the 
house furthest east). There is a lady who lives up the path from Granny's house, 
she is standing in a fenced in pen. If you throw the pigs into the pen, she will 
give you 20 rupees each. You need to sneak up on the pigs by crawling (hold R, 
but not while you have any weapon/item drawn). I find it easiest to crawl next 
to them, as opposed to in front or behind. Also, you can cut down trees and 
grass for all kinds of goodies. 

Fully equipped and ready now, Head back to Tetra, talk to her, and choose the 
top option so you can sail off to adventure!

After watching some more scenes, you'll find yourself on the boat. Turn around 
and then head forward into the door there. Go down the stairs you see. Walk 
forward until a bucktoothed pirate (Niko) starts talking to you. He wants you to 
do this little puzzle, so let's humor him. Besides, the plot won't advance 
unless you do. Jump across the platforms, swinging from lamp to lamp (using the 
d-stick up and down to gain momentum (though you won't need to here, just for 
future reference) and the A button to let go), until you reach the end. Simple 
stuff, really, and since there's no penalty for screwing up, you can figure it 
out on your own. If you take too long, or hit the left button, the platforms 
will lower. Just hit the same button (by jumping onto it) that he did (the right 
one) to raise them again. He's shocked you made it, and lets you pass to a 
treasure chest containing the spoils bag. It holds some special items enemies 
drop, but it's not important now. Grab it, and Tetra will yell for you. Head 
back up to the deck. Tetra is in the crow's nest, so climb the ladder to join 
her.`,
