C) WINDFALL ISLAND AND THE "QUEST" FOR A SAIL
---------------------------------------------------------------

You wake up on a boat. A talking boat. You will be seeing a lot of this boat, 
but you don't usually have to talk to him if you don't want to. His name is 
"King of Red Lions," but that is long and unwieldy, so we'll change that to 
King. Your boat's name is "King." King babbles on and on about some stuff. The 
only thing of interest is that he confirms what many of you may have thought, 
that the mysterious man was none other than Ganon himself. He also tells you 
that he needs a sail, so if you want to go anywhere, you'd better get one in 
this town you're conveniently at (Windfall Island). A sail costs 80 rupees, 
which you may or may not have, depending on what enemies dropped, etc. If you're 
short, run around town cutting up pots and things to get the dough. Flowers work 
nicely too. Don't pick on the pigs, please. You'll die. In the town, there is a 
man dressed as an Eskimo (he reminds me of Iceman from Megaman 1, but his name 
is Zunari). He sells the sail, so talk to him and choose the top option to buy 
it. Equip it to one of your buttons. Let's go look around town a little more 
before we leave, though. Directly above your boat is a cliff with a grave and an 
Elvis impersonator (Tott) on it. On the wall behind them is a door, enter that. 
This is some kind of jail cell with a little Christmas elf guy in it. Smash the 
jars to your left to find a switch. Use it to open the door and let him out. 
It's Tingle. He gives you a map to his island (drawn in crayon, did Aryll do 
this?) and the Tingle Tuner (GBA dealie). If you have a Game Boy Advance, this 
comes in handy sometimes. If not, oh well. You need to let him out anyway. Now 
go into the cell he just left, and you'll see a large crate. Push it to the left 
or right (hold the R button to push/pull things), and go into the little hole 
there. Go into first person mode by pushing the C-stick up (it makes navigating 
holes easier), and take the following path at the intersections: left, right, 
left, right, straight, straight, straight, right, straight, straight, straight, 
right. You'll be in a room with a chest containing the Picto Box (camera). 
Follow the little tunnels back to the cell, then leave through the door you came 
in. Turn left and go around the side and up a wooden ramp. At the top, turn left 
and go through the archway. Along the left wall is a door with a camera above 
it. Go inside. Talk to the bearded man here (Lenzo) and then walk past him to 
some stairs. Go up them and you'll be in Lenzo's photo gallery. He will come up 
and talk to you. Look at each picture, then leave.

Turn right around and go back inside, and talk to Lenzo again. He wants you to 
become his assistant, but you need to pass a little test first. He wants you to 
take a picture of someone mailing a love letter. The mailbox is back near the 
entrance to town. There are some docks there, stand on them and use your camera. 
Center the viewfinder on the mailbox and wait for a man wearing red (Garrickson) 
to approach (it takes a WHILE). There are two tricks here. First, make sure you 
get the mailbox and the man's whole body in the shot. Also, you need to take the 
picture while he has the letter in his hand, right as he's putting it in the 
box. When you get it, go back to Lenzo. Show him the picture (lock onto him and 
use the camera, select the picture, and hit A). If you got it right, you hear 
the good old Zelda "A-ha!" music (as opposed to 80's A-ha music, "Take On Me"). 
Talk to him again and he gives you a second test. You need to find someone who 
is scared. In town, right next to Iceman (Zunari), there are some stairs you can 
go up that lead to like a bar. There is one man sitting at a table with a 
pitcher and some cups. Grab a jar and throw it at him, then take his picture 
while he is shaking (make sure you get his whole body in it). Show Lenzo the 
picture, then talk to him again for the final test. Leave the store and turn 
right. Walk past the first arch and go into the second. Turn right back around 
and aim at the lady in orange. Eventually a man with red hair will talk to her. 
Take their picture (full bodies!) to pass the third test. This one is annoying 
because the damn kids are marching around and screw up the shot. For your 
trouble, he gives you a joy pendant. He wants you to get him a firefly, but we 
can't do that yet.

That's enough for now; we'll be back here later. Go to King. He'll talk to you, 
choose the top option then hop in (get around to the side and hit A). Use the 
sail and you'll be off. 

Turn to the right until you're going in the direction the arrow is pointing (the 
direction of the wind). After that, just go straight. You should see a tall 
structure in the distance, aim for that. You won't encounter any enemies yet, 
because you have no way of fending them off. It'll take a few minutes. If you 
get bored, hit R and you'll jump. That usually amuses me enough. Once you get 
close enough, you'll automatically land.`,
