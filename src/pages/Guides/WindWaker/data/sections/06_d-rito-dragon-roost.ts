D) THE RITO TRIBE AND DRAGON ROOST ISLAND
---------------------------------------------------------------

I particularly like the music here. Anyway, you see various shots of this new 
island, including one of a dragon on top of a mountain (volcano, whatever). He's 
useful later. As you leave to check the place out, King gives you the Wind 
Waker. This is a little conductor's baton that functions much like the ocarina 
from Ocarina of Time. He teaches you how to use it with some practice songs. Use 
the C-stick to mimic the notes as the little metronome dealie at the top ticks 
back and forth. Also, a basic song has 3 notes, but if you hold the D-stick to 
the left, you can enter 4. Hold it to the right, and you can now use 6. Various 
songs have various lengths. Coincidentally, if you hold the D-stick up, the 
notes are louder, down for softer. It doesn't affect the game any, but just 
worth pointing out. Lastly, if you screw up a song, you have to wait until all 
the notes are completed to redo it, BUT, if you hit left or right on the D-stick 
and change the number of notes, then change it back, it resets everything. Save 
a little bit of time, and a lot of frustration that way. The Wind Waker is very 
useful, so equip it right now.

From where you are, leave King and head forward and slightly to the right into a 
little cave that leads through to the other side of the island. Once here, you 
will see a tiny island with an arch. You may also see a boat. That's the 
traveling salesman. We'll see him later, not now. Swim over to the island and 
examine the left tablet there (the intact one). Hmm, those symbols look 
familiar. Use your Wind Waker and play Up, Left, Right. This is the Wind's 
Requiem. Play it whenever you need to change the direction of the winds (which 
is ridiculously often). A little frog guy (Zephos) comes up to see you, and he 
tells you what I just said. He also tells you that his brother, Cyclos, is upset 
because his monument is broken and is going around the sea starting cyclones. 
Head back to shore, through the little cave, and head right. Use the bomb plants 
you see to blow up boulders and go up and around the ramp (going right at the 
fork). They get progressively trickier, but nothing too difficult. At one point 
there is a ledge you have to cross, go across it and then drop back down a level 
to the last boulder (this one has two green blocks on it. Step on the green 
blocks, drop down a level, and pull the bottom one out. This makes it easier to 
get in and out of here. Hop back up on top, and continue through another little 
cave to the birdman from the beginning of the game. He talks, then go up the 
ramp some more and into a cave.

Welcome to the city of the Rito. You talk to their chieftain, and he tells you 
about Valoo, the dragon. Apparently, he's been kinda moody lately and that 
screws up their society. See, the dragon is involved in like a Rito bar mitzvah, 
and his son (Prince Komali) can't grow wings until Valoo gives him a scale. As a 
result, Komali has been really depressed. He asks you to try and cheer Komali 
up. Quill also gives you the delivery bag. This one holds random things, letters 
and such, that people give you. Being a good hero, we will help out. But we need 
to check this place out first. Head up the ramp to the first door and go in. 
Talk to the little bird girl there. Her name is Medli. She's relatively 
important. She wants you to give a letter to Komali, and you put it in your new 
bag. Go back out and continue up to a little desk with a mail sorter guy. The 
first mini-game. Yay. Talk to him and choose the top option twice. Basically, 
you need to sort the mail. Pretty straightforward. First you have to get 10 
right, then 20, then 25, and you are given 30 seconds each time. Keep playing 
until you get 25. It might take a bit, but even if you're bad, eventually you'll 
get lucky with like 5 of a kind in a row. You get rupees for doing a good job. 
Do that, then go out the little door to the left of him. Come right back in, and 
there is a different person there. He's in awe of your mad mail sorting skillz, 
so show off and get 25 again. He will be so blown away that... he wants you to 
run an errand for him. He wants you to put a letter in a mailbox. Head down the 
ramp to the very first door you came in (directly to the right of the bottom of 
the ramp). Head down and eventually you will see a mailbox on your left. Go to 
the menu, equip his letter (by hitting X, Y, or Z on the bag, then again on the 
letter, his is the blue one), then use it on the mailbox. It costs 5 rupees 
postage. Some reward. Back into the bird town, and go into the door almost 
directly across from the entrance. There's a little path that leads to another 
door. Go in and give this kid Medli's letter. Go back out to bird town and go 
into the only door on this floor you haven't gone in yet (it has feathers 
hanging from the arch and a guard next to it).

Lovely weather out here, huh? Take note of these red plants and go left and down 
into the area below. Look, it's Medli. Talk to her and choose the top option. 
Apparently she isn't very good at her bird-dom and needs help getting up to the 
area in front of you. Your job is to pick her up and throw her up there. Back up 
a little and onto the rock formation there. Use the dust as a guide and throw 
her when the wind is blowing towards where she wants to go. You can try multiple 
times if needed. When she makes it up, she gives you a bottle. Gotta love these 
things. Equip it, wade in the water you see, and use it to fill it up. Head back 
to those red plants you saw before (by climbing the broken rope bridge) and use 
the bottle to water one and make it grow into a bomb flower. Use that to blow up 
the boulder in the lower area and flood it. Now swim across to where Medli just 
went. There are two statues on either side of the lava. Pretend you're Kareem 
Abdul-Jabaar and sink a bomb flower in the pot the right one is holding. Then 
jump onto the platform it creates and do the same to the left. Stay out of the 
lava (duh). Continue right on into the first real dungeon. Whee.
