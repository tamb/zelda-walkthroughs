H) RETURN TO WINDFALL ISLAND AND MORE PIRATE FUN
---------------------------------------------------------------

For some reason, you stop as you enter the square, just raise your sail and 
continue on to the island. You'll land automatically again. You see Tetra's ship 
as you enter. From your landing point, turn around and head towards the building 
you see (the bomb shop). To the left of the building is a ledge you can shimmy 
across to gain access to the back. On the back wall of the building is some ivy 
you can climb to enter a little hole. Go forward and you'll see a scene with the 
pirates. They're robbing the shopkeeper. Oh well. PAY ATTENTION! Tetra will 
leave at one point, and the two remaining pirates will mention a password (3 
times). You should be able to remember it long enough, but if not, go talk to 
King and he'll tell you again. When the pirates leave, you leave too.

Go to the pirate ship (it's over by the gravestone) and talk to the door. Enter 
the password exactly as it was said (case matters), and if right, you can get 
in. Head down to where you got the bag earlier, and there will be another game 
for you. Step on the right switch to open the bars, then just swing across, 
using R to change angles when needed, and you will get bombs as a reward. Nice.

Go back to King. He's moved to the docks, just head for the red triangle on the 
minimap. Now you're saying "Let's go fight a dungeon to get that third pearl," 
right? Wrong. We're headed back to Outset Island, where we started way back at 
the beginning. Hop on boat, set the wind southwest, and use your map to plot a 
course for (2,1).
