I) GETTING THE THIRD PEARL AND RAISING THE TOWER
---------------------------------------------------------------

We could do a few other things now, pick up some upgrades and stuff, but we'll 
wait, and I'll explain why later. For now, we just want to get to Outset Island. 
Again, you land automatically. 

**GBA note** Turn on the Tingle Tuner here and wander around the isle. 
Eventually, Knuckle, Tingle's blue brother, will show up on the GBA. He will 
yell at Tingle for putting a sign on the Tingle Tower (which Knuckle carved) and 
will only forgive him if Link does what he says (and you can't open any doors in 
the meantime). So, first, go to the bath which is behind Grandma's house. Hop in 
and Knuckle will tell you to go to a ladder no one uses: the one that leads from 
the pier into the sea, right under the watchtower you started the game on. Next, 
you need to go to the biggest rock on top of the hill, which is back up near 
where we found Tetra. Luckily it is on the near side, because the bridge is out 
(damn giant bird). Just go around the hill and get onto each of the three rocks 
there. It's easier than trying to describe it. Lastly, walk off the broken 
bridge. He'll say you win and do two things. A) He goes home (which means you 
can take his picture for the Gallery); and, B) he gives you the "hand-me-down 
Tingle Tuner." Where the Tingle Tuner is a Game Boy Advance, the HMD Tingle 
Tuner is a Game Boy Color/Pocket. It takes the place of one of Tingle's 
functions and is basically a store. It makes buying bait easier later, you won't 
need to find another shop for it. **end GBA note**

Head to grandma's house real quick if you have a fairy in a bottle. On the way, 
check the mailbox. I had 3 letters: a map of the traveling salesman's locations, 
20 rupees, and another heart piece. Yay. Grandma's in the kitchen/bedroom on the 
bottom floor. Get close, lock on, and use the fairy on her. She was sick, now 
she's better. She gives you soup for helping her, it refills hearts/magic and 
you get two doses per bottle. Plus, it's free. You can get more when you've 
drunk it all, too. Too bad you can only have one bottle of it at a time.

I'd skip this like the other upgrades, but we're already here, so might as well 
get it. Plus, when I explain why I didn't want you to get the others, this 
doesn't fall under that category. Head up to where we saved Tetra. Little imps 
and chuchus will attack you on the way. Kill them or run, it doesn't matter. The 
rope bridge is broken, so you'll need to set the wind W and jump from the 
highest point on this side and float over. Head into the cave, and go around the 
way we did to get Tetra. At one point, you'll see a large boulder. Blow it up 
with your new bombs and drop into the hole you find. Go to the giant shell and a 
fairy will make it so you can hold more rupees. If you didn't have a fairy to 
save grandma, you can grab one now and go back to the house. Otherwise, make 
your way back to King.

Hop in, equip your bombs to one button and sail around the island, staying 
relatively close to it. Eventually, you'll be sucked into a whirlpool. While 
going around, if you look at the cliff wall, you'll see a portion that is 
obviously out of place. Shoot it with your bombs (a cannon when on the boat). 
There are three sections, top, middle, and bottom, blow them all up, from top 
down. We're not made of bombs, so be conservative. You'll enter the new cave 
automatically, and a giant fish (Jabun) will say hi. He gives you the third 
pearl. That was easy. Now we need to put them in place.

If you look at your map, three spots are now highlighted. At each, there is a 
very small island with a statue. You put a pearl in each one. The only 
"difficult" part is getting there. Just avoid any enemies and you'll be fine. My 
suggested course is NE from here to (4,3), then N to (4,5), and lastly SE to 
(6,4). While you are at (6,4), look around for a boat with some people on it 
wearing diving helmets. That's Salvage Corp. Sail up to them and the head guy 
will give you treasure map #34. Not too shabby. Thanks to DarqKnyght for the 
info. Avoid whatever enemies you can, kill whatever you can't. Also of note, you 
want to avoid the giant tornado. When you see it, you'll be able to tell the 
difference between it and a regular one. If you get sucked up, you'll be 
randomly teleported and need to correct your course accordingly.

After you put all three orbs in place, you get a cool cutscene. Our next 
destination is the tower we've just unlocked. Luckily, the cutscene took care of 
our travel arrangements for us. Sail in.
