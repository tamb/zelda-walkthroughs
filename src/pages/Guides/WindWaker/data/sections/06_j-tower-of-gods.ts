J) DUNGEON #3: TOWER OF THE GODS (WATER)
---------------------------------------------------------------

The first part of this dungeon requires the use of King. First, you have to 
realize there is no wind inside of the tower. How do we get King to move then? 
Simple. There are actually two ways to do it. If you raise the sail and hold up 
on the D-stick, you'll move. Likewise, if you hold down R, then hold up on the 
D-stick you'll also more. The other thing about this dungeon is that the water 
level rises up and down periodically. Some areas need a high water level, others 
like it low.

That being said, head directly to your right upon entering. In the lower right 
corner of the room, you'll find a door (when the water is low). Enter.

Here you meet yellow chuchus. They're easy enough, the only thing about them is 
that you need to stun them first with the boomerang, then attack, or else you'll 
get electrocuted (similar to the green ones from Link to the Past). When the 
water raises, you can get access to the upper part of the room. Several of the 
wall panels are bombable, namely the center and far panels on the left side and 
the center panel on the right. The important one is the right-center one, which 
when bombed, reveals the map. Move the crates around to get at it, if need be 
(you don't have to, though). Leave where you entered.

Head to the upper right corner of this room now. There is a ledge you can get at 
once the water level is high. Hop up there. You'll see a door with bars on it. 
To solve the simplest puzzle ever, pick up the statue slightly to the right of 
the door and place it on the glowing spot. Enter.

Kill the yellow chuchu. Wait for the water to lower, then jump down into the 
little pit here. You want to move a crate so it is on the glowing spot, then 
climb out. When the water is down, the crate will be on the switch, creating a 
bridge. When it is high, the crate will float, making the bridge disappear. 
Using that knowledge, run across the bridge while it is there, grab the weird 
statue, then run back across. Leave the room (still with the statue).

Turn left, and you'll see a little place where you can put the statue (it looks 
exactly like where you took it from). Doing so lowers a gate. Hop in King and 
head to where it was (the center of the right side of the room). Go around the 
bend, hop up on the ledge, and put the statues where they so obviously belong. 
Enter the door.

There's a crate puzzle here. Wait for the water to lower, and hop down. Walk 
straight forward, skipping the first and second crate. Grab the third one you 
see on the left, and pull to the right so it is in line with the first two. Then 
pull it two steps towards the back of thee room. Wait for the water to raise, 
then use the crates to get back to the ledge you started on. Done correctly, you 
should have the crates set up as 4 equally spaced stepping stones to the other 
side of the room. Grab a staff, light it, hop across, and light the two torches 
there. Grab the chest for a key. Leave, killing the yellow chuchus.

Hop into King and go to the left side of this room now. You should see three 
large panels that you can blow with your cannon. Do so. Go across to the area 
you just exposed (you'll need to get out of King). Kill the yellow chuchu and 
head upstairs. Kill another, grab a staff, make a torch, and head back down 
(with low water). Light the two torches here. Run back up and claim your new 
chest, a joy pendant. Enter the door up here.

Kill the red bubble (two sword swings, you don't need to boomerang him) and grab 
the compass in the chest. There's a second chest here too, but we can't get it 
yet, so leave.

Go back downstairs and into the door here.

Kill all the chuchus to make light stairs appear. Use them to get up top, grab 
the weird statue, and run out the door when the water is low.

Bring the statue up top and put it where it belongs. Finally, we can enter the 
dungeon proper. Hop in King, sail over to where you just opened (center-top part 
of the room), and go into the door there.

I HATE this room. It's not difficult, it just rubs me the wrong way, I guess. 
Besides, I've never liked these beam guys (beamos). Look at the center of the 
room (but don't step on the gold floor) and kill the two rats with the 
boomerang. Then grab one of the statues on either side of the door. Hug the wall 
and work your way to the other side of the room, where you can put it on a 
switch. Repeat. If you are more than one step from the wall, the beamos will fry 
you. Be careful. There are only two statues, so stand on the third switch 
yourself to activate the platforms. Hop from one to the other to get to the top 
of the room. **GBA note** The last platform goes higher than you need to because 
it lets you reach another (stationary) one. Tingle bomb a question mark there 
for another gold statue. **end GBA note** Enter the door.

There's not much to do here (yet), so head over to the right door and enter.

Kill the yellow chuchu and hop on the floating platform. Ride on it to the other 
side, but don't get off yet. Let it go back and forth one more time before you 
do, that way the yellow chuchus on the other side will make like lemmings and 
you won't need to bother with them. Go through the door.

Go up the light stairs and run to the other side of the room. Look at the black 
tablet, then hit R. This will lower the platform and this black statue will 
follow you. Go slowly around the little maze, not cutting corners, and make your 
way back to the beginning of the room. You will need to pick up the statue and 
jump across the gap once you pass the maze. Carry it through the door.

Fairly straightforward. While carrying the statue, ride the platform to the 
other side and go through the door.

You will automatically drop the statue and a scene will happen. In the center of 
the room, a tablet will appear. Go up to it, read it, then crack out the Wind 
Waker. Play Left, Center, Right, Center to learn a new song. This lets you take 
control of certain people and things. Important now and in the two next 
dungeons. Go into the left door now.
Kill the red bubble, then grapple across to the other side of the room (straight 
across, not left). Kill the other red bubble and go in the door. Grapple across, 
walk up to the statue and hit R. Pick it up and put it down to get it to stop 
following you. Walk to the switch and stand on it to make a path appear. While 
doing that, play the Command Melody. You are now the statue. Move across the 
bridge, then hit either R or Start to switch back to Link. Grapple back across, 
pick up the statue, and go through the door.

Place the statue on the switch, then grapple over to the right side of the room. 
Enter.

This is a mini-boss, but you should pay a lot of attention to this fight. You 
fight about a million of these guys later in the game. There are two ways to 
fight this knight (a Darknut, BTW, another member of the Zelda 1 reunion): the 
easy, safe way, and the easy, slightly risky way. They're very similar and start 
out exactly the same. Draw your sword, lock onto him, and use the parry attack. 
You will cut off a piece of his armor. Now, for the easy, safe way,  repeat 
until he is dead. For the other way, repeat until his helmet is off. Now he's 
susceptible to our standard tactic of boomerang-then-attack. If he still has his 
chest plate on, though, you will need to sneak around behind him to attack until 
it gets cut off. The second way is slightly faster because you can get multiple 
hits in, and it's also invaluable when fighting multiple darknuts (the parry 
attack becomes less useful when three guys are swinging at you). Anyway, pick 
whichever tactic you like best, then kill him. You will get the bow and arrows. 
Yay. Leave.

Right in front of you is an eye switch. Shoot it with an arrow. Kill the red 
bubbles too if you can. Grapple back to the statue, pick him up, carry him 
across the moving platforms and through the door. Ignore the little guys that 
start hopping around.

The statue will automatically hop away again. Head back into the right door (the 
first one we entered in this room).

Kill the yellow chuchu, then shoot the flying guy (wizzrobe) with an arrow twice 
to kill him. Hop onto the floating platform and face right. Shoot the eye switch 
when you see it, then hop over to the new platform that appears. Ride it up and 
enter the door.

There are two giant hopping statues here (Armos knights). The trick is to shoot 
them in the eye, then throw a bomb in their open mouths. Kill both to make a 
chest appear (joy pendant). Leave, ride the platforms again, and go back to the 
room where you learned the Command Melody.

Go into the only door you haven't yet, the top one.

Kill the keese with the boomerang. There are two platforms here suspended by a 
chain. Hop onto the left one and turn left. Blow up the wall and enter the door 
here.

There are two circles on the floor. One has a Triforce emblem, the other has 
something different. Stand on the different one and play the Wind's Requiem. A 
chest will appear and the Armos knights will come to life. Kill them and take a 
treasure map from the chest (#30). Leave.

Go straight across from where you are now to another door. Enter it.

Shoot two red bubbles with arrows. On a platform to your upper right, you can 
barely make out an eye switch. Shoot it. There is another to your lower left, 
shoot that too. Now hop from platform to platform, working your way up to a 
chest in the upper left with a key. You can keep climbing to find an eye switch 
above the door, which creates a chest with a joy pendant. Using the leaf, you 
can glide back to the door and leave.

Climb the ladder to your left, and pick up a statue. Hop to the right suspended 
platform and drop it there. Take another and do the same thing. Now if you hop 
on the left platform, it won't sink and you can continue across to the locked 
door. Enter it.

Climb on top of the gold block you see in front of you. Use the leaf to glide 
over the beams, press R, and get the statue. Play the Command Melody and have it 
hop onto the switch. Switch back to Link and run past the stopped beams. Pick up 
the statue and head out the door.

Drop the statue and kill the wizzrobe. Leave the statue where it is, and get to 
the other side. This time, you'll need 3 statues to weigh down the right side, 
hop back, get the black statue, get across, and go out the door.

With the third statue in place, a beam appears in the center of the room. Enter 
it to go up to the third floor.

In front of you are two statues. You're going to need to put each on a switch. 
Avoid the beamos by walking on the raised part of the floor close to the 
elevator thing we just arrived from. Step on the third switch to turn off the 
lasers and get the boss key. The statues are alive now (they are Armos, the 
little brother to Armos knights) and we need to kill them. Shoot them with an 
arrow to stop them, then hit the purple crystal on their backs with your sword 
twice to kill them. Once they're dead, you can leave through the only door in 
the room.

You want to climb these stairs, but you'll need to kill stuff. Two boomerangs 
will kill the birds, and an arrow shot will kill the beamos (but only while 
they're firing, and then it only takes out the blue ones; roll past the red 
ones). Make your way to the boss door at top. Smash the jars here to refill life 
and ammo, bottle a fairy if you need it, and go in.

                              BOSS: Gohdan

This boss is pair of floating hands and a head. He says he is going to test you. 
Again, take a picture if you're going for a complete gallery. Just make sure the 
head part is in it. It has several attacks. The head likes to rapidly fire 
fireballs at you, which you should roll out of the way of. The hands try and 
knock you onto the electric floor to the side, or clap together and smash you in 
the middle. What you want to do is hit each hand with two arrows, then each eye 
with two arrows, then toss a bomb in its mouth. If you run out of arrows, it 
will drop some for you. Why, I don't know. Seems to me it would be smarter to 
keep a weapon you're vulnerable to out of the hands of your enemy. Three bombs 
in the mouth will kill it. Get the heart and get out of here.

You're at the top of the tower. Climb the ladder here to a bell tower, and 
grapple onto the bell. As you swing, you will ring it, creating a little glowing 
spot in the water you and King automatically enter.
