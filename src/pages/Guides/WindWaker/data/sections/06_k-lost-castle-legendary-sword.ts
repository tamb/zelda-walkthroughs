K) A LOST CASTLE AND A LEGENDARY SWORD
---------------------------------------------------------------

You're teleported under the sea to Hyrule Castle. Good old Hyrule. The first 
thing you'll notice is that everything is black and white (except for you). Head 
into the castle.

A bunch of big moblins and darknuts were apparently raiding the castle. They are 
frozen in time, though, so ignore them. Down some stairs are three huge 
triangles. You want to try and get them onto the Triforce mark on the floor by 
pushing and pulling. It's hard to describe exactly what to do, so I'll leave it 
up to you. It's not difficult. Once you do that, the Link statue will move, 
revealing some stairs. Go down them.

Climb down the stairs here and go to the center of the room. King talks, and 
then you see... the Master Sword! Yank that baby out! Not only do we have a 
better sword now (twice as strong), but we've also restored color to the castle. 
No greyscale for us! Of course, nothing comes without a downside. All those 
darknuts and moblins are alive now. 

Head back upstairs and kill them all. Yes, ALL. This is the hardest thing you've 
done yet, but there is no real strategy to offer. Try and isolate the enemies. 
Kill the moblins first, as they are easier. And USE YOUR BOOMERANG! It should be 
second nature by now, but I can't emphasize enough how much it will help you. 
Once they are all dead, head up the stairs and out of the castle back to King.

Sail into the glowing spot and get back to the world. Once you do, turn around 
and sail right back into the tower. Head over to the left and go to the room at 
the top of the stairs. Shoot the eye switch to open the way to a chest 
containing a treasure map (#6)). Get back to King and leave the tower.
