 L) RETURN TO THE FORSAKEN FORTRESS AND A DESTINY REVEALED
---------------------------------------------------------------

Our next destination is (1,7), the fortress from back at the very beginning of 
the game. You may run into the giant tornado on the way. If so, get caught in it 
and then shoot the pink guy (Cyclos) at the top three times with your arrows. Do 
it quickly or you'll be teleported. He'll teach you the Ballad of Gales for your 
troubles... Sort of. He doesn't give it to you as blatantly as some of the other 
songs, he gives you a hint, though. The song you want to play is Down, Right, 
Left, Up. Personally, I encountered him on this trip in square (2,6). You may 
have different results, I dunno. Whatever the case, if you get the song, ignore 
it for now. It's just one of those "if you see him, you might as well get it 
now" things. Plus, once you do it, he doesn't appear anymore, so no more random 
teleports. Yay.

In the center of the south wall of the island is a giant wooden door. We've got 
the Master Sword now, stealth is for suckers. Watch out for fire from the 
turrets surrounding the door and blow it up with the cannon (two or three 
shots). Head inside.

King drops you off at much the same place you started the last time you were 
here. Like I said, stealth has gone the way of the dodo (or Gleeok for a Zelda 
reference), so don't worry about barrels. Besides, there aren't any to be found 
out here. Head up the stairs to the big courtyard dealie and a mini-boss.

If you fought Ganondorf in Ocarina of Time or Aghanim in Link to the Past, this 
will be a piece of cake. This black floaty guy (Phantom Ganon) is a big pong 
fan, so let's play with him. Use your sword to bounce his fireballs back at him 
(he may bounce them back at you too, so stay alert). Eventually, one will hit 
him, which stuns him. Run over to him (take off your lock-on targeting while 
running, you move faster) and whack the hell out of him with the sword. Repeat 
until dead. Open the chest for the hammer. Yay. Head in the only door you can 
reach.

Head in the door on your right.

Walk through the little hall to the end where there are these spiky post things. 
In case it wasn't obvious, whack them with the hammer to pass. Take the door 
ahead of you and to the right.

If you get caught by moblins this time, it isn't necessarily your demise, so 
kill these guys and continue. At the end is a jail cell. Move the barrels to 
find the switch that will open it and get the chest for a heart piece. We've got 
4 now, which makes a complete extra heart. Yay. Head back through the door, 
smack the posts, and back through that door to the first room.

This time take the other door, which is past some posts and a trio of moblins. 
Head around the corner and watch out for what appears to be a black hole in the 
floor. These are floormasters (cousins of the wallmasters from previous games), 
and they are nasty. As you walk close, they will grab you and pull you into the 
hole. If they do so, you get warped somewhere, usually the beginning of the 
dungeon. The trick here is the same you use for every other enemy, boomerang 
then sword. You can only get in one sword hit safely before they need to be 
stunned, though, so be on your toes. After six or seven hits it will die. 
Continue around, kill a moblin, and go into the door.

There is a moblin bust above the door that will fire lasers at you, so hug the 
right wall. Get the chest on one of the bunks, then climb up. Head through the 
door on the right. 

By the way, you could have gotten the heart and the rupees the last time you 
were here, but why? It's much easier with the sword. If you want tactical 
espionage action, go play Metal Gear Solid instead, okay?

As you pass through the hall, there will be an alcove on the right. Inside is a 
ladder. Climb up and take out the light bokoblin. Yes, we have to do this again. 
After you do that, look to the right of the ladder before you climb down. There 
is a break in the wall here that lets us jump to a ledge below and get at 
another light bokoblin. Two in one shot! Nice! Climb back down the ladder and 
head down the little ramp here. Enter the hallway when you get a chance, and 
take the door to the left.

Kill the bokoblin. The last time we were here, we could swing to the other side 
on a light. Apparently they wised up and took the light out. No matter. Use the 
leaf to make the jump across, pound the posts, and continue. If you don't make 
it, there is a ladder on the bottom that will let you climb back up and jump 
right to the target ledge anyway.

What's a hall without alcoves? Take the left, up the ramp, ladder, take out the 
last light bokoblin. Yay. Back down both ladder and ramp, left into the hall, 
take the door.

Again, the light we were friends with has gone AWOL, so glide across and take 
the door.

Neither alcove is of particular importance, so take the door.

Head around, killing the moblins if you care to, and take the stairs to the same 
door we took the last time we were here.

Up the sets of stairs which are now infested with imps (miniblins, really, but I 
call them imps). Kill any that get in your way, but they spawn infinitely, so 
keep moving. Go left at the landing and continue up. Pound the posts and move 
on. Shimmy across two ledges, go up some stairs, smack the post there, and into 
the door.

Finally! With the help of Tetra (who takes particular note of your sword (and it 
takes note of her too, apparently)), we've saved Aryll! After only about 22 
pages of walkthru. And that stupid bird didn't stop us! Oh wait, he must have 
heard me, because here he comes now. Luckily, Aryll and the other girls are 
safe, because the room starts flooding and they probably would have drowned. 
There are a series of ramps along the walls of the room. Run up them. The bird 
will both attack you and the ramps periodically. If the way becomes smashed and 
you can't cross, wait for the water to rise high enough for you to swim across. 
Work your way to the top of the room, ignoring all the bokoblins. If need be, 
boomerang them and get away. If you stay and fight, the bird will have time to 
break more ramps, which is bad. If you see him getting ready to attack, roll out 
of the way. It's faster. At the very top of the ramp, the bird will land and not 
let you pass. I'm getting sick of this guy, aren't you? Smack him in the face 
with the hammer to knock him down in the water. Go up the last bit of ramp and 
climb out onto the roof. Boss fight!

                           BOSS: Helmaroc King

We owe this guy some payback. And a free portrait if you're going for a complete 
Gallery. Take note of the spikes on the walls. Is there any game where touching 
these is GOOD for you? Same here. The bird will fly around and eventually do one 
of two things. Hopefully, he'll land. Run up close to him, then run away and 
he'll chase you. After about four steps, he tries to peck at you and his beak 
gets stuck in the concrete. Stupid bird. Smack him in the head with the hammer 
while he is prone. You want to do this four times to break his helmet. The other 
attack (which he does much more often after the third time you hit him) is a 
diving attack. Roll out of the way. Simple enough. Alright, once the helmet 
comes off, you want to entice him to get his head stuck again. While he's stuck, 
smack him as much as you can with the sword. After breaking the helmet off, if 
you use the grappling hook on his head, he'll do the peck attack right away. He 
also likes to flap his wings now to try and push you into the spikes. Just keep 
rolling towards him to stay out of danger (you can't roll while locked on, 
remember that). After you hit him enough (usually three sword barrages), he will 
DIE. Throw ME into the ocean, will you? Chump. Take the tastiest heart in the 
game and go up the ramp. Go in the door you see.

Prepare for some MAJOR plot exposition. If you don't like spoilers, skip the 
next two paragraphs.

At last, Ganon. Nobody but NOBODY kidnaps our sister and gets away with it. 
Plus, he's the one who told that bird to toss us into the sea. We need 
vengeance! We've got the Master Sword, and Ganon is fazed a little by just its 
presence. Charge! Oh, wait, we suck. After getting slapped clear across the room 
(literally), Ganon pulls out his own sword to finish us off. Ganon tells Link 
that by pulling the Master Sword, he completely unlocked Ganon's power. Things 
look grim for our hero! Just as he's about to deal the final blow, Tetra shows 
up to distract him. It works long enough for a temporary reprieve, but he grabs 
Tetra by the arm. The Triforce of Power (that Ganon has, ALWAYS) reacts, and he 
is shocked. He calls Tetra "Zelda" and cackles evilly. That can't be a good 
omen. Quill and Komali swoop in and save you both. And not a second too soon. 
Hey, look, it's Valoo! He torches Ganon's place. Well, looks like we won't be 
seeing him again. Right.

You're back at the tower (you know, the last level). You and Tetra sail into the 
shining spot again. Lead her into the castle (take her picture here if you're 
going for the Gallery) and then down to where you got the Master Sword. There's 
somebody here. Evil music plays... Oh, wait; it's just the King of Hyrule. He 
explains how Hyrule was sealed under the sea by the gods to protect it from 
Ganon. He also tells you that he is King. Then he reveals Tetra's destiny. She's 
been carrying a large chunk of the Triforce of Wisdom around with her and she 
didn't even know it. The King pulls out the missing piece, puts them together, 
and Tetra is revealed to be Princess Zelda herself! You are charged with two 
quests. The first is to power up the Master Sword so you can fight Ganon. The 
second is to find your own Triforce, the Triforce of Courage. Zelda will wait 
here until you're done. Make it snappy. Go back to King and get out of here.
