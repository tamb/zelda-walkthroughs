N) POWER BRACELETS AND FIRE MOUNTAIN
---------------------------------------------------------------

Our little collection run is almost done, but we need to go get two items. 
Teleport to (6,6). Set the wind S and go to (6,5). Slight NW of center, there is 
a volcano. Fire an ice arrow into the lava spewing from the top to freeze it. A 
5 minute timer will start, so hurry up. Hop off of King and climb to the top of 
the volcano, where you should jump inside. To get to the top, go right at the 
first fork, then shimmy across a ledge to keep going. Once inside, kill the 
keese you see with the boomerang. Hop across the platforms in the lava (to the 
left), killing more keese. At the end, there are two magtails. Kill them to make 
a chest appear containing the power bracelets. Once you get them, the timer will 
stop. Pick up the giant stone head and pass through to the shining light that 
will take you back outside. Get back to King and teleport to (4,2).
