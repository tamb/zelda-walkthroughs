P) ENLISTING MEDLI'S HELP
---------------------------------------------------------------

Time to get back to our quest. There are two dungeons we need to go to, and the 
order doesn't really matter. I prefer to do the earth level first, because I 
find the boss easier and the level more fun on a whole. I just really like 
shining the lights. I'm a freak that way. Teleport to (2,1) and land on the 
island. Did I say we were getting back to our quest? Almost. One quick thing 
here. Remember where you dropped off the pigs before? Well, one of them got 
obesely fat. Go pick it up and take it out of the pen. We needed power bracelets 
to pick this guy up, that's how big he is. Take him down the path and across the 
bridge. After you cross, walk straight ahead to a little wall there. You'll see 
two spots of black soil on the ground. Drop the pig and spread some all-purpose 
bait on the right hand one. He'll eat it, dig down, and a piece of heart will 
pop out. Bring him back to his pen and go get on King.

Sail E to (3,1). At almost dead center is an island. Put a hyoi pear on your 
head and take control of a bird. Fly to the top of this mountain and there is a 
piece of heart you can fly through. Switch back to Link and you'll have hit four 
pieces again. Nice. 11 hearts now. Pick up the stone head to go inside the cave. 
Check out the tablet, then play the Wind Waker. A song will pop up, Down, Down, 
Center, Right, Left, Center. A zora (from Ocarina of Time, not Joe Millionaire) 
will appear and talk to you. She says you need to find someone with a harp like 
hers. Go to King and teleport to (6,6).

First, head back to near where you learned the Wind's Requiem. As you pass 
through the little cave that leads there, turn right. Pick up the boulder you 
see and jump into the hole. Go through the door here into a room with 6 doors: 
the one you just came through, one with bars, and four with torches above them. 
As you go into each torch door, you will appear in a nearly identical room, 
except with enemies. Kill them and the torch will light, then go through an 
unlit torch door. Repeat until all are lit and the bar door will open. Go into 
it to get a chest with 50 rupees. Hey, every little bit helps! Leave this room, 
then go through the door directly across from you to get to the light pillar. 
It'll take you outside. Now head to the bird town.

Go up the ramps to the door directly left of the mail sorting guy. Turn right 
and grapple across. Climb up some ledges and a ladder to find Medli. Look, she 
has a harp. Talk to her, then play the new song (Down, Down, Center, Right, 
Left, Center) on the Wind Waker. You work your midget elf charm on her and she 
agrees to come with you. Yay. Okay, actually, she faints and the zora convinces 
her to go. You're back in King, so get back to that other island. As you 
approach, you'll automatically land. King tells you you can use R to call Medli 
and have her follow you, or use A to pick her up (just like those statues from 
the tower...). You're inside the cave, so go up to the tablet and play the song. 
Medli joins in and the tablet shatters. You hop into the hole and the shadow 
dungeon.
