Q) DUNGEON #4: EARTH TEMPLE (EARTH)
---------------------------------------------------------------

This is easy enough. Pick up Medli, and jump off the ledge towards the door. 
She'll flap her wings and you'll glide over to it. Pick her up and go through.

As soon as you enter the room, drop Medli and go on ahead. You'll want to do 
this in every room, clear out all the enemies before solving the puzzles. So, 
kill the three moblins, then grab Medli again. Go up the stairs on the left and, 
holding Medli, glide over to the pillar you can reach from up here. Put her down 
and stand on the switch. That remark earlier about Medli being like the tower 
statues wasn't random. Crack out the Wind Waker and play the Command Melody 
(Left, Center, Right, Center). Now you're Medli. If you hit A, you'll start 
flying. Fly over to the next pillar and stand on the switch. The bars will open. 
Fly down to the door. Switch back to Link and jump down to join her. Pick her up 
and use the new door.

Drop Medli and kill the red and green chuchus. To kill the black ones, you need 
to get them to walk (ooze?) into the light. They'll turn to stone and you can 
smash them good with your hammer. Shoot a fire arrow at the top of the warp jar 
to open it. If you so desire, you can also burn the banners with fire arrows to 
get a joy pendant and 5 rupees (you'll need to use your boomerang to snag them). 
Time to learn the most important technique in this dungeon. Switch to Medli and 
have her step in the light. When you do, her harp will react. If you hit A now, 
you hold the harp in front of you and shine light (hit B to stop). You can aim a 
little, but you need to be looking in the general direction of what you want to 
shine at. First, there is a faint frame of a treasure chest you can see back by 
the warp jar. Focus light on it for a second or two, and it'll turn into a real 
chest. Now turn around and focus light on the two statues that sit between the 
doors. They'll disappear. Switch back to Link and snag the map (in the chest) 
and the magic bottle (behind one of the statues). Grab Medli and go through the 
door (the one you didn't just come from).

There are no enemies here, so you don't need to drop Medli. Instead, carry her 
into the light on the right, put her down, and switch to her. Shine the light 
into the fog in front of you to find a switch. Shine it so there is a path to 
it, and, while still shining, switch back to Link. Have him pound the switch 
with the hammer (if you get fog on you, you can't use items, so stay out of the 
fog). Pick Medli up and go into the new room.

Drop her and look around. Two red bubbles will come out of coffins. Kill them. 
At the back of the room, on the left hand wall, there is a ladder. Climb it. 
Pull the huge block there as far towards you as you can. Switch down to Medli 
and, using the new light, make the chest appear. Have Medli run to the corner by 
the switch. Switch back to Link and open the chest for a key. Two floormasters 
will appear. The one back by the chest doesn't care about you, just Medli. Keep 
her away from it. There is another up by the door that is much more "friendly." 
Kill it. Grab Medli and (avoiding the floormaster) head back to the fog room 
(we'll do the other room here later).

Run straight across to the locked door and enter.

Drop Medli. Kill the red and green chuchus, then burn all of the flags on the 
walls. One will expose light. Use that to turn two black chuchus to stone. Put 
them on the switches to make stairs appear. Run up (ignoring any more chuchus 
that appear) and push the huge block over the edge. Go back and kill all the 
chuchus. Switch to Medli and have her fly up to the door. Switch back to Link 
and use the huge block to get up there too. Grab her and go through the door.

Drop her and kill the floormaster. 

Mike 'hobbit' Macnamara:

"Also when fighting floormasters 'rang then to stun them then fire an ice
arrow then as soon as possible(while the floormaster is iced) fire a fire
arrow. it will kill him faster(the same goes for any multiple hit creature
that can get frozen solid)"

If you are in trouble, use that method, but I'd rather save the magic. Up to 
you.

Push the first block all the way to the left. It will click in place. That will 
open some light. Switch to Medli and stand in it. On the walls, there are little 
emblems. "Sun spots," if you will. Shine the light on them (there are 4) and the 
statue that is sitting on a block until they all disappear. Switch back to Link. 
Pull/push the blocks into place. Climb up and get the chest (a compass). Switch 
to Medli, have her fly up, then switch back. Grab her and go through the door.

Drop her and go up the stairs. Kill the two moblins. The ghosts (poes) will give 
you trouble. Get them to drop their lanterns (try hitting them with the 
grappling hook, it works sometimes) and they'll possess you. It screws up your 
controls for a few seconds (or until you get hit). Either way, once everything 
is dead, stairs will appear. Don't go up them yet. Switch to Medli and have her 
fly up to the right side of the room, where there is light. Use it to fry the 
statues across the way, then hop back down. Switch to Link and grab the 
butterfly from the chest. Grab Medli, go up the stairs and into the left door. 
Drop her and jump down into the pit. There are five coffins here. As you 
approach each, the lids will fall down (and do damage, so don't approach head 
on). Three have re-deads (zombies with huge hoop earrings). They scream and 
latch onto you if you're not fast, so, um, be fast (and for god's sake, take 
them one at a time). 

Pius has this tip:

"Also, about redeads, remember at the beginning when he makes you crouch to 
sneak up on the pig? you can do that with redeads, get right next to them, stand 
up and smack'em hard. =)"

One more has a 10 rupee piece, and the last has a key. Once all the re-deads are 
just deads, the ladder will drop and you can climb out (with the key). Grab 
Medli and go back through the door.

Go into the locked door. You can't bring Medli in here.

After a step, a stalfos knight will appear. These guys are a cinch once you know 
what to do. Stay away and throw a bomb at him. It will explode, blowing him 
apart. Wail on the skull with your sword. Repeat until dead (if you're lucky, 
you can kill him the first time). After he dies, two more will appear. Take them 
one at a time.

Mike 'hobbit' Macnamara offers this strategy: 

"I found out the easiest way to kill a Stalfos Knight. Make sure you have Bombs, 
The Bomerang and the Hammer all set then target Him and throw a bomb(making sure 
it lands infront of him) and when he blows up boomerang his head then use the 
hammer on his head. Instant kill."

After they are dead, stairs will appear leading up to the mirror shield. Grab it 
and a light will appear in the center of the room run down and stand in it. Use 
your shield like Medli's harp to shine a light on the mask above the door (you 
need to have your sword or another one-handed weapon (i.e. boomerang, but not 
the hammer, etc.) drawn to use your shield, remember). Leave.

Medli is to your right, but ignore her for now. Go kill the moblins (again). You 
can kill the poes the right way, but it's not worth it. Let them possess you. If 
they don't drop their lanterns, climb up to where the light is and shine it on 
them until they turn solid, then kill them with your sword. Once everything is 
gone, switch to Medli. Fly up into the light and shine it down into the center 
of the room. While still shining, switch to Link. Stand in the light beam that 
she is shining and use it to break the sun spot below her. Switch back to Medli. 
Go into the new corridor Link opened and use the light to break the statue. 
While still shining light where it was, switch back to Link. Use the beam to 
break the sun spot and get more rupees. Grab Medli and go through the door here.

We're back in this room. You can use Medli to glide down out of the fog. Go into 
the door on your left (the first room we entered from here).

Drop Medli and kill the red bubbles and "your" floormaster. Pick her up and 
bring her back to the switch, avoiding "her" floormaster. Drop her on the switch 
and go into the door (without her).

Break the sun spots for a joy pendant. Leave.

Medli is back by the other door, grab her and leave.

Drop her and switch to her. Have Medli stand in either light and shine it at the 
nearest eye of the huge mask. While still shining, switch to Link and have him 
shine on the other, activating the sun mask, lighting up the room, killing the 
fog, and most importantly, creating stairs. Grab Medli and go down them and 
through the door.

Drop her and go down these stairs. Meet the blue bubbles. Shoot an ice arrow or 
blow a gust at them with the leaf to put out the flames, then kill them with 
your sword. Try not to fall down. **GBA note** From the side of the room you 
start on (i.e., before crossing the bridge), use the deku leaf to glide over to 
the platform on the left. Glide to the next platform, then use Tingle to bomb 
the question mark on the little ledge here. Hop over to it, kill the red bubble, 
then open the chest for the fourth golden statue. **end GBA note** After the 
bubbles are dead, run back and grab Medli. Bring her to the tablet, drop her, 
and play the dungeon's song (Down, Down, Center, Right, Left, Center). She will 
join in (again) and the tablet will shatter (again). Grab her and go through the 
new door.

Drop her and kill the re-deads (if you shine light on them, they get stunned, 
making it easier). Shine light on both mirrors to break the large statues, and 
then shine on the small statue directly to break it. Now grab Medli and go into 
the door that was on your right as you came in (though it was behind a statue).

Drop her and go down. This part is a little difficult. You have to run through 
the fog to the other side, but this place is full of floormasters. Avoid them as 
best you can. You want to go to the left side immediately, move up until a 
floormaster blocks your way, run across to the right side, then move up to the 
back wall, go left a little and you'll be at the end where there is a chest. 
Open it for a key and to make the fog disappear. Kill the floormasters one at a 
time (there are 6) to make another chest appear (with a treasure map inside, 
#12). Go back to the door, grab Medli and leave.

Drop Medli and go into the other door on this level (not the one you need to 
climb on a block to reach, and yes, we are leaving her here).

As you approach the fog, a floormaster will rise up. Shoot it three times with a 
fire arrow to kill it. There is still one in that fog, so be alert as you run 
across to the other side. Pull the statue into place. Burn the flags for a joy 
pendant. Hit the switch with the hammer to make light shine into the mirror and 
then the other room. Before jumping back into the fog, kill the second 
floormaster just like you did the first. Go back across and leave.

Switch to Medli and have her fly up to the higher door here. Switch back to Link 
and push the block up against the wall so you can climb up too. Grab her and go 
through the door.

Drop Medli and kill the enemies. Here, lure the poes into the light. They'll 
turn solid for easy disposal. Once they're dead, switch to Medli. If you stand 
in the light but at the right wall, you can shine onto the two statues that are 
next to each other. The third is trickier. Shine where the left-most statue was, 
then switch to Link. Stand in Medli's beam and use it to shine onto the third 
statue for a door. Grab her and go through it. 

Drop Medli and boomerang the keese. You want to go through this room (straight 
ahead first, then back to the right fork) slowly, opening each coffin and either 
killing or taking whatever is inside. The straight path has 2 re-deads and 20 
rupees at the end. The right path has a stalfos and a tablet at the end. Run 
back, grab Medli, and bring her to the tablet. Play the song to open it, grab 
her, and go through the door.

Carry her down the stairs, then drop her and blow open the warp pot on your 
right. Go to the left where there are some vines. Climb across and down them to 
the next set of stairs. Stop and switch to Medli. Fly down to Link then switch 
back. Pick up Medli, carry her down the stairs, to the door, and through it.

Drop Medli and switch to her. Fly to the ledge directly across from you and 
stand on the button. Switch back to Link. Drop down a level and start on the 
right side. Pull the first mirror until it drops into place. It will shine light 
right over a platform. Switch to Medli. Fly over to that platform and shine 
light to both break a statue and create a chest. Keep shining it at the chest 
(towards the front side) and switch back to Link. Open the chest for 50 rupees, 
then use Medli's beam to break four sun spots on the right-hand side. Pull/push 
the mirrors that were behind the sun spots and the statues into place. Now run 
over to the left side of the room. Pull the mirror that you can into place. 
Again, the beam is shining right over a platform. Switch to Medli, fly over, 
break the statue and create the chest. Shine the light to the left of the chest 
(from Medli's point of view) and switch to Link. Grab the chest (joy pendant), 
then break not only the 4 sun spots behind Medli, but also the one on the left 
wall next to the chest. Pull the two mirrors into place and watch the magic. 
Now, switch to Medli. Again, the light is shining over two platforms back near 
the giant mask. Go to one and while shining on the eye, switch to Link. Have him 
get on the other platform and shine into the other eye. The mask will activate 
and a new door will appear. Grab Medli and go into it.

Drop her. There are two blue bubbles here (remember, use ice arrows/leaf to make 
them vulnerable) and a knight. Kill them all. The way to the boss key will be 
opened, so grab it, then Medli, and leave.

You broke a total of 9 sun spots in this room. Four on either side exposed 
mirrors, leaving one more. Go to where that was and you'll find a door. Enter 
it.

Drop Medli and shine the light onto ONE of the coffins. A stalfos will come out. 
Drop down and fight him. Pull a block out of the wall to climb back up. Repeat. 
Once all three coffins are open and the stalfos are all dead, a chest will 
appear. Open it (treasure map #20), grab Medli, and leave.

Drop her and then switch to her so she can fly up to the door we first entered 
this room from. Switch back to Link and climb up there via the ladder. Grab her 
and leave.

Run up to where the stairs end and the vines start. Drop Medli and climb 
up/across the vines to the other side. Continue up the stairs to the first 
landing, then switch to Medli. Fly up to where Link is and switch back. Grab 
Medli and glide over to the boss door. Use the pots to restock and go in (Medli 
will stay outside).

                               BOSS: Jalhalla

This boss is relatively easy. He's a giant poe. You want to find the light and 
shine it on him until he is solid. Then you pick him up and throw him at one of 
the spiked columns along the walls. He will break into a bunch of little poes. 
Kill as many as you can until he reforms, then repeat. When all the little poes 
are dead, so is he. Grab your heart and walk to the shining spot (in the center, 
not just the light). Medli will come in, and with the help of the zora, they 
will play a little ditty and power up the Master Sword. Nice. You will be 
teleported back to King and it's time to go power this baby up one more time.
