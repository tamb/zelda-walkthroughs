S) DUNGEON #5: WIND TEMPLE (WIND)
---------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the second sword dungeon. Makar works much like Medli. He follows you 
if you hit R near him, and you can pick him up and carry him (he's not strong 
enough to be a glider, though). You can switch to him using the Command Melody, 
and he can fly or plant seeds in sandy patches. More on that second bit in a 
minute. Pick him up and go through the door.

Drop Makar and explore. There are some important things here you want to take 
note of. In front of you is a spring platform. What you do is climb on top and 
use your iron boots to weigh it down. Take them off again and you go flying. Got 
it? Now drop to the floor. First, kill the wizzrobe. These guys are all over the 
place here. Take this one out with your sword. You'll see two brown patches 
here, those are the sandy spots I mentioned. Walk forward under the tornados to 
fight a stalfos. There is also a warp jar here, burn the top off with a fire 
arrow. Go back by the sandy patches and use the spring to get back up top. 
Switch to Makar and drop down. Step on the each sandy patch and hit A to make a 
plant grow. After both are planted, a chest appears. Walk under the tornados and 
fly up to the ledge. Stand on the button to stop the tornados and switch back to 
Link. Drop down and get the chest (100 rupees), then use the spring to get back 
up. Use this spring here, and at the height of your jump, use the leaf to glide 
over to Makar. Pick him up and go through the door.

Drop Makar and kill the two Armos here. Use the leaf to power the switch and 
open a gate. Roll past the trap (that's the official name of the sharp thing, 
from way back in the first Zelda) then switch to Makar. Fly over the trap and 
plant two trees. The bars will open, so switch back to Link. Grab Makar and go 
through the door.

Drop Makar and switch to him. Fly to the right platform, plant a tree, then the 
left, plant a tree. Fly to the top and plant one more and the bars will open. 
The bad side effect of this is that 4 inescapable floormasters will appear and 
grab Makar. You automatically switch back to Link. **GBA note** If you drop to 
the floor, you can find a question mark. Tingle bomb it for the last golden 
statue. **end GBA note** Go into the door on your right.

Run to the center of the room and kill the two peahats (as you fight peahats in 
this dungeon, use the grappling hook on them; we need as many golden feathers as 
possible). You will see Makar, but he is in a jail cell you can't break quite 
yet, so leave him. Kill the two Armos knights and go through the door they were 
guarding.

Kill the peahats and roll past the trap. Don't drop down over the edge. Instead, 
stand on the weird tile you see here and put on iron boots. You'll break through 
and fall. Kill the floormaster and use the wind switch to open the gate. Kill 
the floormaster on the other side and use the spring form the first side to get 
back up (and for god's sake, aim towards the gate when you land or the trap'll 
smack you. Walk across the raised gate, grabbing the chest on the left (a joy 
pendant). Roll past the trap, kill two more peahats, and go through the door on 
the right.

What you want to do is use the leaf to glide into the tornado and then use the 
boost to reach the platform on the left. Step on the switch, to lower a gate, 
then use the leaf to get on top of it. A wizzrobe here will give you trouble, so 
take him out with a fire arrow (he's too far away to lock on, you'll have to 
aim). Use the leaf to glide into the tornado and then straight across through 
the hole in the gate there and onto a ledge with a chest (map). Drop to the 
floor and run back to the beginning of this room, and climb up the vines there 
to get back up top. Use the tornado and the leaf to get on top of the gate you 
opened again. Go through and jump to the ledge on your left. Use the leaf to 
jump to the next ledge. Now turn to your right and use the tornado and the leaf 
to glide through the other gate here (the one we haven't used yet). As you go 
through, keep gliding to the next tornado for another boost up to an open gate. 
Land on top and kill the nearby peahat. Ignore the wizzrobe and glide into the 
next tornado. It'll give you the boost you need to reach the wizzrobe and kill 
him. The other two peahats will probably attack you, so kill them too and go 
through the door.

First, burn the lid off of the warp jar with an arrow. Then step on the weird 
switch here. Doesn't do much, huh? Put on the iron boots. The added weight is 
enough to push it down and open up the huge metal gate in the center of the 
room. Jump into the center and fall all the way down to the bottom using the 
periodic float technique from way back when. Kill any peahats that follow you 
down and go through the door without a lock.

Pick a tile and use the boots to drop down. I like the second tile from the 
left. You'll see a couple statues, a box, a box with a spring platform, and a 
lot of spikes. Spikes are bad, so don't touch them. In the back of the room, 
there is a tile on the floor that is different. If you look right above it, 
you'll see a hole. You want to push the spring box on top of that tile. Next, 
take the other box and push it next to the spring box so you can climb on top. 
Do so and spring back up. Open the chest for a key and to stop the spikes. Go 
back to the other side of the room and drop through any tile. You'll fight 
either red chuchus, floormasters, armos, or green chuchus. Hop back up and 
repeat until all the tiles are broken and all the monsters are dead. Hop back up 
one more time to grab the shiny new chest that appeared (treasure map #5), and 
leave this room.

Run across and into the locked door for a mini-boss fight. It's a red wizzrobe 
that summons other enemies. He'll fly around the top of the room, you'll want to 
shoot ice arrows at him when you can (the better ones don't like ice). Take out 
the enemies he throws at you to make it easier. Once he's dead, kill any 
leftover summoned enemies to get a chest with the hookshot in it. You can 
grapple onto lots of things, but in this dungeon, you want to look for the 
bull's-eye mark. Speaking of, there is one in this room. Hookshot up to it and 
pound the switch with the hammer to open the door back out of here. Use it.

Hookshot your way up the walls. When you can't go any higher, if you look, there 
should be a ledge across the way with a chest. Glide over to it with the leaf, 
grab it (compass), and use the spring to go even higher. Continue climbing until 
eventually you reach Makar 's cell. Almost forgot about him, huh? Stand slightly 
to the side of the giant maoi statue (Easter Island head) and put on the iron 
boots, then hookshot the target. Instead of you going to it, the statue comes to 
you, leaving the cell open. Grab the chest for a joy pendant and then grab 
Makar. Head back to the center of the room and drop to the platform below and to 
the right of where you are. Drop Makar here and hookshot up to the next alcove, 
the one you first entered this room from a million years ago. Switch to Makar 
and fly up to Link. Switch back, grab Makar and go through the door.

Drop Makar and kill the wizzrobe. Hookshot your way up to the top using Makar's 
trees. Switch to Makar and fly up to Link. Switch back, grab him, and go through 
the door.

Drop him and kill the blue bubble. What you want to do now is switch back and 
forth, having Makar fly to the closest platform, planting a tree, Link hookshots 
to it and kills the closest bubble. Do that until you get to the top. Be 
careful, at the very top is a floormaster. Once you're up there, grab Makar and 
go through the door.

Put Makar on one switch and stand on the other to open a bunch of stuff. Grab 
him and go right back through the door you just left.

Work your way back down to the door you first entered this room from and go 
through it (with Makar, of course).

Work your way back down here too, going into the door that is straight ahead, 
not to the left.

Drop Makar. Roll past the trap, get up to the gate (if it's open, step on one of 
the switches to close it), then turn around and look up. You can grapple your 
way up to the top. Use the wind switch here to open the gate and make a floor 
for you. Over on the other side are some maoi heads you can pull down (boots and 
hookshot) for a joy pendant and some rupees. Break through the tile to get back 
down, fight some Armos, and get back to Makar. Grab him and go back into the 
room you were just in.

Go into the room on the right.

Back here again. Take note of the room across from you, the door that the Armos 
knights guard. Drop Makar and kill the peahat. Switch to Makar. Float down to 
the floor by slowly tapping A. Eventually you'll fall, but it'll be less. You 
don't actually want to go all the way down, just to the level where you got the 
hookshot. Here you can find two sandy patches, plant trees. A giant fan should 
start up. It goes on and off periodically. Fly into the tornado to get to the 
door I told you to take note of. Switch to Link before the enemies hit you. 
Glide across to Makar with the leaf using the tornado as a boost. Kill the Armos 
knights and the peahat that follows you. Don't go through the door just yet, 
though. Just above where you are now is an alcove you can reach with the leaf 
and the tornado. Up there is a chest with a joy pendant in it. Turn back to face 
the center of the room and look up and to the left. There is another alcove 
there. Use the leaf and tornado to get up there. Switch to Makar, fly up there, 
and switch back. Grab Makar and go through the door.

Drop Makar and kill the horde of armos. When they are dead, a gate will open. 
Grab the chest inside for a key, pick up MAKAR and leave.

Get back down to the door I told you to take note of (go one at a time), have 
Link pick up Makar and enter.

Remember this room? Drop Makar and take out the two peahats. Roll past the trap 
and drop through the hole on the left where a tile used to be. Kill the 
floormaster. Activate the wind switch and kill the other floormaster. Use the 
spring platform to get back up. Roll past the next trap and kill the two 
peahats. Switch to Makar. Fly over the traps (one at a time is safer) and stand 
in front of the tablet. Switch back to Link. Get in front of the tablet and play 
the dungeon's song (Up, Up, Down, Right, Left, Right). Grab Makar and go through 
the new door.

Drop Makar and kill the darknuts. It's tough because there are three, but not 
impossible. Try to separate one from the pack and pick on him. Also, if you cut 
the chest plate off, you can shoot fire or ice arrows at them. Once they are 
gone, a gate opens. The chest has the boss key inside, so take it. Grab Makar 
and get out of here.

Drop Makar and activate the wind switch. Get across to the other side, either 
one at a time or together, it doesn't matter. Go through the door back to that 
central room.

What I do is, while still holding Makar, jump right off to the bottom floor. 
You'll take a quarter heart damage, but that's nothing and it's quicker and 
easier. Hug the wall as you jump so you don't land in the fan (you'll land on 
the hookshot level instead). Wait for the fan to stop and jump through the hole 
to the area below it. Go into the locked door.

Drop Makar and kill the 2 stalfos and the wizzrobe. I kill the stalfos first, 
but it doesn't really matter. Then hoookshot your way up the sides of the room 
to the top, where there is a switch for you to activate (the kind you step on 
with the boots). Work your way back down using the boots to pull down any maoi 
heads. Some drop rupees and stuff, but 2 have bokoblins inside for you to kill. 
Once those two are dead (as well as everything else in the room), a chest will 
appear with a treasure map inside (#35). Grab Makar and go through the new door.

Drop Makar and kill the bokoblins and Armos knights. Walk to the edge, right 
before the tornados, and switch to Makar. Get to where Link is, and then fly 
across (above the tornados). Land on the other side and plant a tree, being 
careful not to be taken by the floormaster. Switch back to Link and hookshot 
across. Kill the floormaster and the flying plants. Grab Makar and go through 
the door.

Drop Makar and put on your iron boots. Don't take them off until I tell you to. 
There are three boxes, three traps, and a pit here. You want to use the boxes to 
block the first two traps, and then go get Makar. If you look along the walls, 
there are some brown outcroppings. Take Makar past the first two traps and put 
him down next to one of the walls, so when the wind blows him, he stops at the 
outcropping. Grab the third box and push it into the pit to make a bridge. Now 
go back and grab the box that is blocking the first trap, and pull it towards 
the chasm. We need this, and we don't want to get hit by the trap while moving 
it, so pulling is the way to go. One you're clear of the trap, move the box so 
you can push it across your makeshift bridge to block the third trap. Grab Makar 
and run across the bridge, past the third trap, and into the room. Once you're 
in the little room, you are clear of the fans and can take off your boots. Drop 
Makar by the tablet and play the dungeon's song. Restock, burn the lid off the 
warp jar, and enter the boss room.

                              BOSS: Molgera

This is a giant sand worm, but he's not that hard. You want to pull his tongue 
out with your hookshot and attack it with your sword. Be careful not to get 
sucked in (while tracking the tongue, do back flips (down on the D-stick and A)) 
and watch out for the little worms he sends at you. He also flies around the 
room sometimes, but he is slow and easy to dodge. That's basically it. The 
hardest part is locking onto the tongue with all the baby worms in the way. It 
took me four tongue pulls to kill him. Take your heart and walk to the center. 
Weird boy and Makar will jam again and the Master Sword will be fully powered 
up. Nice. You'll be teleported back out to King who will remind you of your 
other quest: to get the Triforce of Courage. In a move that hasn't been done 
since the very first Zelda, we need to go assemble 8 pieces. We'll do that and 
collect items all at the same time. Let's rock.
