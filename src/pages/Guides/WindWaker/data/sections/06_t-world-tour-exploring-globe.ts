T) LINK'S WORLD TOUR #1: EXPLORING THE GLOBE
---------------------------------------------------------------

We're almost fully equipped now, so we can tackle just about anything the game 
throws at us. What we're going to do is go to each square in the world and do 
what we can there.

One thing would get tedious if I typed it all of the time, though, so I'm only 
going to describe it once. EVERY square has three things: a buried treasure 
found via map, an island or island formation, and a map fish. The map fish can 
always be found relatively close to the island/island formation. You can see him 
jumping in and out of the water from far away. You want to approach him, lock 
on, and use all-purpose bait on him. He will return the favor by drawing you a 
detailed map of that square. We want to map every square. Therefore, you need to 
find and feed the fish in each one. I will call this "get your map", and it will 
be the first thing to do in every square (save the four you already have mapped, 
of course). Take note of the places you can warp to with the Ballad of Gales. 
Each time you are in one of those squares, check to make sure you have enough 
bait to make it to the next one. If not, warp to (6,6), buy some, then warp 
back.

Are you ready? Teleport to (3,5). Sail NW and then W to (1,6) (as you may have 
noticed, I stopped telling you to set the wind as I think it should be obvious 
by now). We don't need to go to (1,7) because A) it is mapped already; and, B) 
we've done everything we need to do there (at the moment). So, get to (1,6). The 
island is in the NE corner. Get your map, then prepare for battle. This is Four-
eye Reef. It looks like the face of a die, and all 5 other faces are represented 
in other squares. Inside are warships and cannon turrets. You want to kill them 
all. Do so and a chest will appear. This particular fort has 4 turrets (one on 
each "dot") and two ships. Once you make the chest appear, sail back to the 
entrance. Use your hookshot to hook up to a flag along the wall. Run all the way 
around the wall to the W face of it (you started on the N face). Get to the 
highest point close to the chest (which is on the upper left "dot"), set the 
wind to NE, and use the leaf to glide over to the chest, which has a treasure 
map in it (#19). Get back to King and sail S to (1,5).

We've been here before (it's a fairy island; Western Fairy Island to be exact). 
The island is slightly NW of center. Simply get your map and continue S to 
(1,4).

Three-eye Reef is located SW of center. Get your map and clear the fort (each 
dot has two turrets, one on either side, and there are two ships though one may 
come out of the fort). A chest will appear on the lower-left "dot." Get up on 
the wall (you always get up the exact same way, using the hookshot on a flag 
that is to the left as you enter) and go to the W face. Find the nice high 
point, set the wind E, and glide on over. Grab the chest for another treasure 
map (#32). Get back to King. We can dig up a map treasure here. Bring up your 
map screen, then hit Y. This goes to the treasure map screen. Select a world 
square, then hit R to select a map to compare it to. Obviously, we want (1,4), 
and we want treasure map #38. You can see a huge pillar of light shooting out of 
the water inside the reef, but I prefer to use the map as my guide. When you 
(the little triangle) are right over the X, drop your grappling hook. You get a 
chest with a piece of heart! Sail S to (1,3).

This place (Needle Rock Isle) is exciting. The island is to the SE of center, so 
get your map. There are three warships (one of which is gold and has a mohawk) 
near the island. Sink them all, and one will drop a special treasure chest (you 
need to haul it up from a glowing spot like when you fought the squids). Inside 
is a Triforce Map (#5). This is very important. Trust me. Land on the island, 
there's even more stuff to do. Now, there is a block of ice on top of a hole. 
Melt it with a fire arrow and drop down. There are a bunch of torches you need 
to light here (6, to be exact) using fire arrows. Look all around and use your 
telescope, that's the best advice I can offer because it is kinda hard to 
describe. You get 100 rupees for your efforts. Take the shining spot back out of 
here. A bird will attack you, so kill it. Run to where there is a fire. Use a 
pear to gain control of a bird. You want to fly up to the top of the spire here, 
avoiding the other birds. The easiest way I found is to spiral around it. You 
can also try to take out the birds beforehand with arrows, but I never have any 
luck. Anyway, at the top of the spire is a crystal. Fly through it to shut off 
the flames, then switch back to Link. Open the chest for a piece of heart. 
Finally, we can leave. Sail S to (1,2).

Diamond Steppe Island is dead center. Get your map. A few things here. First, 
there is some treasure to be found. Use treasure map #23. The chest you pull up 
has a piece of heart. Yay! Now, you can't "land", per se, on the island, but you 
can get close and grapple onto it. Do so and get up to the top. Jump into the 
hole. This is a maze of warp jars. Jump into the first one you see and it will 
take you to an area with four more (with lids that must be burnt off). Now, one 
is the one you just came through, one is wrong (and warps you back to the 
beginning), one takes you to a joy pendant, and one is right and will take you 
to another area of four jars (except the one that had a joy pendant is "wrong" 
now and takes you back). Continue until you get to the end where you grab a 
ghost ship map. Watch out for floormasters, especially the one at the end. He 
grabs you as soon as you land, so you need to be quick. Once you get it, leave 
and go back to King. Go to your treasure map screen and look at it. It's a chart 
that correlates moon phases to islands. One of them is the diamond island we're 
on. Basically, play the Song of Passing repeatedly so it cycles night-day-night-
day until that moon phase. When it is, sail around the island and you'll find a 
ghost ship. Sail into it. Drop down and fight a bunch of enemies (ghosts, a 
stalfos, a wizzrobe or two, and a re-dead). Kill them all to make a ladder drop. 
Climb up it and open the chest for another Triforce map (#4). Too bad you can't 
read it... yet. You'll be teleported back to King, and now it's day. Sail S to 
(1,1).

The island here is slightly W of center. Get your map, then land on Horseshoe 
Island. Ever played mini golf? Well, we're gonna play now, Zelda style. As you 
try to walk up, tentacles will pop up out of the ground. Behind them you can 
make out a flag. You want to take the balls here and get one into a hole that is 
in front of the flag. Do so and the tentacles will disappear. Do this for two 
more holes to get to the top and make a chest appear. Ignore it for now and drop 
into the hole. Kill the mothulas for treasure map #8. Use the pillar of light to 
get back out. Now, from up here, set the wind E and use the leaf to glide to 
your chest, treasure map #28. Hop in King and sail to (2,1).

Home again, home again, jiggety-jig. We don't need a map of here, so ignore the 
fish. You want to land and head up to the broken rope bridge area. There is a 
man there with a telescope, and if you follow his line of sight, you can see a 
giant stone head. Climb up to the highest point here, set the wind NW and glide 
to it. Once you land, pick it up and drop into the hole. This is a LONG mini-
dungeon. You have to go through 30 floors, killing enemies on each one. They 
don't drop items (though there are refills after each 10 levels). This is your 
last chance to back out, though you shouldn't need to. To continue, go into the 
hole. To leave, use the pillar of light. 

Here's a tip sent in from Ray Strife that may make your life easier:

"I have another bit of info I'd say it's more of a glitch than an info. Im 
taking credit for this and but I don't know if some one else has found this 
out.  Im guessing that your going to be the first one to post this info on a faq 
if you decide to post it.  You know on the mini dungeon on Link's home island 
where you keep going down the holes to advance and the enemies get harder as 
they go along?  Well, as you said that when you kill the badies they don't drop 
anything to help refill you magic meter or give you any hearts.  But I found out 
that if you use your grappling hook on them the grappling hook still steals 
hearts, magic jars, and rupees from the enemies."

If you're fighting hordes of enemies, it's not that wise of an idea, but when 
you only have a couple left, hey, give it a shot. Thanks for the tip!

Alright, here's what you'll fight, floor by floor:
1) A bunch of keese
2) A couple imps
3) Some bokoblins
4) Red chuchus
5) Magtails
6) Keese AND imps
7) Fire keese AND magtails
8) Fire keese AND bokoblins
9) 2 moblins
10) REFILL LEVEL (use the light to leave, hole to continue)
11) Peahats
12) 4 green chuchus
13) 5 boko babas
14) Bokoblins
15) A bunch of mothulas
16) Peahats AND boko babas
17) Green chuchus AND bokoblins (in jars)
18) Mothulas AND bokoblins
19) 2 Flying mothulas
20) REFILL LEVEL
21) 3 wizzrobes
22) Armos
23) 2 Armos knights
24) 6 or 7 yellow chuchus (in jars)
25) 4 red bubbles
26) 2 bokoblins AND a darknut
27) Wizzrobe AND 3 armos
28) 2 red bubbles AND 2 Armos knights
29) 2 darknuts
30) The end... ?

Stand on the blue mark on the floor and play the Wind's Requiem to create a 
chest. Open it for another Triforce map (#6). Now, for the astute observer, you 
can make the statue disappear and continue down using the light that shines 
after you open the chest. Only continue if you made it through here relatively 
unscathed, and if your 4 bottles are full (I suggest Granny's soup and 3 
fairies).

31) 6 Re-deads
32) 5 Blue bubbles
33) 6 Black chuchus
34) 5 Poes
35) 3 Flying mothulas
36) Moblins AND Re-deads
37) Flying mothula AND black chuchus
38) Moblins AND Poes
39) Blue bubbles AND Stalfos knights
40) REFILL LEVEL (except with no refills(!?!?), just rupees)
41) A CRAPLOAD of imps (at least 20)
42) A CRAPLOAD of chuchus (red, green, and yellow; use bombs/hammer to stun a 
    lot at once)
43) 5 Wizzrobes (hit the switch)
44) A CRAPLOAD of bokoblins (in the dark, too!)
45) Stalfos knights AND Re-deads
46) Moblins AND darknuts
47) Wizzrobes AND darknuts
48) 3 Stalfos knights
49) 4 Darknuts
50) Heart piece!

In the Japanese game, the bottom level was a stupid 10 rupees. Here, it's a 
piece of heart. Be happy. And that makes 4.

Use the pillar of light to get back out. Go to Orca's house. Give him 10 
knight's crests (you should have that many) and he will teach you the Hurricane 
Spin. It is an upgraded spin attack that uses magic. It isn't useful at all. But 
we're going for completeness.

Go down to King and sail N to (2,2).

NW of center, you'll find Five-eye Reef. Get your map, then clear out the fort. 
You should be getting good at this by now (no ships this time, just several 
pairs of wall turrets). Now, before you hookshot on top of the wall to get your 
chest, sail around to the upper right "dot" and use treasure map #12 to get 200 
rupees. Now get on top of the wall. Of course, they had to put the chest on the 
center "dot." Getting this will be a little more complicated than before, but 
not really since I am telling you what to do and all. There is a spot on the E 
wall that looks tempting to start from, but no. We want the S wall. Near the end 
is a high point you can use to glide to the lower left "dot" (you want the wind 
to be blowing N, but it should be anyway). Now set the wind NE and glide to the 
center "dot." Grab the chest for a treasure map (#41). Hop back in King and sail 
N to (2,3).

In the NE corner, you'll find our "island." As always, you'll want the map, but 
you may or may not want to wait, depending on where the fish is. See, Islet of 
Steel is really a metal fort, guarded by about 4 ships and 2 turrets. You may 
need to kill them all to get at the fish. Regardless of when you do it, you'll 
want to kill everything. Before you go inside, use treasure map #35 to find 200 
rupees right around the island. After that, head inside. Get over to the steps, 
walk up them, and play the Wind's Requiem on the blue emblem. Open the chest for 
another Triforce map (#1). After that, you can leave the fort and sail N to 
(2,4).

We were here briefly once before, if you recall, and our stop will be brief 
again. Greatfish Isle, is dead center. Stop to get your map, then continue N to 
(2,5).

We were also here briefly, too. On the way to the island, there are some pirate 
ships (S of the island) you can fight. One drops 100 rupees, the other drops a 
piece of heart. Both are very nice prizes. Just E of center, there are 3 
watchtowers. You have probably seen these on your journey. The two outer ones 
have 4 turrets each on them. Kill them to create chests. Now the matter of 
getting to the chests. The center tower has a weird ladder thing you need to 
hookshot onto (aim at least halfway up) to climb up top. The center and east 
towers each have stupid prizes (a golden feather and a skull necklace, maybe), 
but the west one has 100 rupees. You need to set the wind W, glide over, and use 
the tornado for a boost to get onto the tower. When you're done, back in the 
boat with you. Rock Spire Island is NW of center, get your map. You can use 
treasure map #2 to get another piece of heart. Sailing around the island is the 
traveling salesman. Stop inside to buy the treasure map (#4) and piece of heart 
(that's three from this single dinky island!) you couldn't get before. It'll 
leave us just about broke, but oh well. Now get to the island itself. This is 
pretty easy, you want to throw bombs at the boulders, timing them so they will 
blow up and take the boulders with them. Get past them to a hole, and drop in. 
Use fire arrows to light two torches here, then fight about a billion keese. 
Kill them all and get a chest with a treasure map inside (#37). Get back 
outside, hop into King, and sail N to (2,6).

We've been here several times. This is where we got the fire/ice arrows, but you 
can't reach that area from where we are. In fact, from where we are, there is 
very little to do. Get your map (the Mother & Child Isles are E of center). 
Using this and treasure map #29, get a 200 rupee piece. Continue N to (2,7).

Finally, somewhere new. Sail N of center to find the Star Island and get your 
map. Use it, in conjunction with treasure map #7, to get 200 more rupees. Land 
on the island. There are several large boulders, which you can either pick up 
and throw or blow up with bombs. It doesn't really matter either way. One has a 
hole under it. Naturally, drop into it. Kill 3 magtails, then 2 bokoblins, then 
2 more bokoblins (with shields), then 2 moblins, and you'll get a chest with a 
piece of heart inside (four again!). Leave, get on King, and go E to (3,7).

This is the Northern Fairy Island from earlier. It is SE of center. Get your 
map. W of center, there is a sub you can (and should) enter. There are 4 big 
moblins inside. Kill them and nothing will happen. Climb back up to the ledge 
you were on when you entered, and use the lanterns to swing across to a little 
door. Inside is a chest with a treasure map inside (#22). Grab it and leave. 
Around the island, you can pull up 200 rupees with treasure map #24. Sail S to 
(3,6).

Spectacle Island is SW of center. Get your map, and you can use it with treasure 
map #22 (the one we just got a second ago) for 200 rupees. Land on the island, 
and climb up to the guy on the little building. He's only awake during the day, 
so play the Song of Passing if need be. He's a lot like the guy from the 
Battleship game back at Windfall Island, but this is slightly different. You use 
the cannon to blow up targets. You get 10 shots to hit 5. Win and you get a 
piece of heart the first time and a treasure map (#17) the second time. The only 
downside is that it costs 50 rupees each try. Just take it slow. That's the only 
tip I can offer. Get back onto King and sail to (3,5). Or use the Ballad of 
Gales, it doesn't really matter.

S of center, you'll find Tingle Island. Get your map and then land. Climb up the 
tower to talk to Tingle. He'll translate Triforce maps at 398 rupees a piece. 
Get one done, but we'll come back for more later. **GBA note** If you found 
Knuckle, he'll be dancing around in some flowers. If you got the golden Tingle 
statues, they'll be here. Talk to the guy in pink (Ankle) and he will pay you 50 
rupees per statue, and a bonus 500 rupees for all 5. **end GBA note** Sail S to 
(3,4).

Another one of these. Cyclops Reef is located SE of center. You know the drill, 
get your map then clear the fort. Again, hookshot onto the wall. This time, we 
want to be on the E wall and glide W to the lone middle "dot." Open the chest 
for a treasure map (#21). Hop into King, but don't leave quite yet. If you 
noticed, we can get that treasure, the one from our brand new map, right here! 
So, go find it and pull up a chest with the light ring map. When there is a full 
moon, special glowing spots (the kind you pull treasures from) appear that 
aren't around when it isn't a full moon. This map tells you which squares have 
those. Not worth worrying about, but we're trying to be complete here. Sail S to 
(3,3).

Very slightly SE of center is a watchtower. Kill all the turrets (there are a 
lot), to make a chest appear. Hookshot up and kill 2 bokoblins. One chest has 20 
rupees, and the other (the one you made appear) has a piece of heart. Whee. W of 
center is Stone Watcher Island. As always, get your map. Land on the island and 
climb up to the top where there is a giant stone head. Pick it up, chuck it, and 
drop into the hole you find. This is another one of those places where you need 
to go into each room, kill the enemies inside, then come out and clear the next 
room. Not hard. Going clockwise around the center room, starting with the first 
door on your left as you first enter (which is the order I always clear these 
places in, for some reason): 4 armos, 2 moblins, bar door, 3 wizzrobes, 5 
bokoblins. After you clear the four enemy rooms, the center room will have 2 
darknuts. Kill them and the bar door will open (it's the one with the Triforce 
emblem above it if you get disoriented in the heat of battle). Enter it to find 
a blue emblem. Play the Wind's Requiem on it to create a chest with another 
Triforce map (#7). Leave, get on King, and sail S to (3,2).

We want to go S of center to find Shark Island. It's shaped like a shark, see? 
Anyway, get your map, then use it (with treasure map #16) to pull up a chest 
with another treasure map in it (#28). Land on the island. We've got a little 
switch puzzle here. First, clear out all the weeds, trees, and bushes. Now hit 
all the switches. Order may or may not matter, I did them in this order: gold 
switch, crystal switch, hammer switch, iron boot switch. The flames will die, 
giving you access to a hole. Go inside and fight imps, bokoblins with shields, 
moblins, wizzrobes, and darknuts. If you can beat this fight, you will have no 
problem with the rest of the game. For your trouble, you get 200 rupees. Leave 
and go S one more time to (3,1).

There is a sub located barely N of center. If you enter and kill a bunch of 
rats, you can get a treasure map (#14). The island itself we've visited a few 
times, it's Headstone Island (the earth dungeon). It's located SE of center. Get 
your map, then sail E to (4,1).

Two-eye Reef is N of center. As if I had to tell you, get your map and clear the 
fort. This is the easiest reef in one respect. Get on the wall and get to the 
highest point on the E wall (the one you start on). Glide W over to the lower 
right "dot" for a treasure map (#13). Sail N to (4,2).

Dead center is a trio of watchtowers. They form like an L, with a westernmost 
one, a southernmost one, and one in the middle. Kill all the turrets you see to 
create two chests (both on the center watchtower). Climb onto the W tower and 
glide over to the center one. Open the two chests here to get a skull necklace 
and treasure map #40. The other attraction here is Southern Fairy Island. This 
will be short. The island is NW of center, so get your map. Now, use treasure 
map #4 to get a piece of heart. Sail N to (4,3).

We've been here before; this is one of the islands where we placed a pearl to 
raise the Tower (Southern Triangle Island). It is located dead center. Get your 
map and continue N to (4,4).

Another sub can be found SW of center. Clear it to get a piece of heart (which 
makes four and yet another complete heart). Six-eye Reef, the last reef, is 
located NE of center. Get your map and clear it. Before you get off of King, use 
treasure map #6 for 200 more rupees. Now climb up on the wall and run to the 
highest point on the S wall (again, the one you start on). Glide N to get the 
chest, a treasure map (#26). Sail N to (4,5).

Another one of those pearl islands (Northern Triangle Isle). It is located dead 
center. Get your map, then use your brand new treasure map (#26) to pull up a 
map of all the giant squids (big octos, but they're not octoroks, they're 
squids, because they have pointed heads), which we killed already. Sail or 
teleport N to (4,6).

Use treasure map #18 to pull up the biggest haul in the game: ONE FREAKING 
RUPEE! I bet the ink and parchment to make that map cost at least 10 times as 
much. Land and make sure it is daytime. You SHOULD be rich, unless you went out 
spending without me telling you to. Go to Iceman's shop and buy two town flowers 
(because you can only hold 3 of his goods and you already have a pinwheel). Go 
talk to Miss Marie in the school about volunteering. Notice the little metal 
platforms she has in her classroom (they're all over the island, too). Put town 
flowers in them. Repeat until every platform on the island (inside and outside) 
has them. There are 14 outside, 4 in Miss Marie's school, 2 in Lenzo's shop, 4 
in the battleship game, 4 in Maggie's house, 4 in the auction house (including 2 
on stage you need to jump to from Maggie's house (the second floor of the 
auction building)), and 2 in the potion shop. That makes 34 total (340 rupees). 
There is a man on a bench near Iceman's shop. Talk to him twice when you are 
done to get a piece of heart. 

Sail N to (4,7).

Gale Isle (the wind dungeon) is NE of center. Get your map, then sail E to 
(5,7).

N (and slightly E) of center is a sub. Inside are about a bazillion imps. You 
can tell your progress because 4 lanterns light up as you go. Clear it to get a 
treasure map (#9). Crescent Moon Island itself is located at dead center. Get 
your map and then use treasure map #11 to get a piece of heart. Now land on the 
island and get the easy chest for another treasure map (#10). Sail S to (5,6).

This island is found SW of center and is guarded by a lone pirate ship. Kill it 
and get your map. Now use treasure map #30 to snag another piece of heart. Land 
on the island. Welcome to Pawprint Isle (called that for obvious reasons). On 
the side of the turtle shell thing is a hole you can crawl through to get 
inside. Drop into the hole there and you'll be in a maze. From where you land, 
go straight into the first area and kill some chuchus. Now take the right 
passage and destroy the boulder you see to open a little alcove. In the alcove 
is a chest with a joy pendant. Go back to where you found the boulder and 
continue the way you were going. Here you can find another chest, this one with 
a piece of heart (and makes four!). Now go back to the very first area and take 
the passage you haven't yet. Lift the boulder blocking the way and grab a chest 
with 50 rupees. Go back to the first area one more time, and on one wall, you 
can see grapple poles. Use the grappling hook to pull yourself up to a ledge up 
there for one last chest with 20 rupees. You can leave this place now. On the 
"toes" of the paw are trees. One is really weird looking (like a cactus). Get 
into King, sail near it, and hookshot up. There is a hole here to drop into. 
Kill some wizzrobes and you'll get 200 rupees. Go back to King and sail S to 
(5,5).

Eastern Fairy island. It is SE of center. Get your map and keep going S to 
(5,4).

The Tower of the Gods. This place is freaking huge, you can see it from squares 
and squares away. As if you couldn't find it, it is dead center. Get a map, then 
use treasure map #14 to get 200 more rupees. Quite the stockpile you should have 
going. We need it for all those Triforce maps, remember. Sail S to (5,3).

Quite a while ago (section m), I told you of a quest with the teacher and 
students at Windfall Island. At the end, you give the teacher 20 joy pendants 
and she gives you a piece of paper. If you haven't done that, go back and do it, 
then come back here. The island is SE of center. Get your map, then use treasure 
map #1 to get 200 rupees. Land on the island. Behind the house is a ledge. Use 
the hookshot to get on top of it, then get a chest here for treasure map #27. Go 
to the door of the house (which looks like a butler) and use the cabana deed on 
it (it's in the delivery bag). Now you can open the door and go inside. Look up 
to see a grapple switch. Activate it and the fireplace will go out, exposing a 
hole. Drop down. This is a maze, so pay attention. You need to keep your 
bearings, even through some (simple) battles. From where you start, go forward 
and take the first right. Follow this path to the fork, and go right. Take the 
ladder here down. Crawl into the little hole on the same wall as the ladder. 
Take the first right (there is no choice). As the forks come up, go straight, 
straight, left. Take the next right (again, no choice) to enter a room of pots. 
Smash them for quite a few rupees. Crawl back into the hole and go left (no 
choice), left, and right (no choice) to find another ladder. Climb up it. Hit 
both switches here with the hammer and take the left door to find another 
ladder. Climb down it. If you are facing the ladder, there are two holes, one to 
your right and one directly behind you. Take the one to your right and follow it 
(there are no forks here). Open the chest at the end for 100 rupees, then crawl 
back to the ladder room. Take the other hole. Again, there are no choices, so 
follow it to the end: another ladder. Climb up. Go out into the big room. Hit 
the switch you can, but don't go through the door. Instead, jump down the hole 
here. Fight two re-deads. There are two pots on one wall. Smash them to expose a 
hole. Crawl in. Follow the path to the end (no forks), where there is one last 
ladder. Climb up to find the familiar blue seal. Play the Wind's Requiem for 
another Triforce map (#2). Hit the switch, and go through the door. Turn left 
and go straight until you hit a wall, then turn left again. Step through the 
door, turn right, right, and then left to get back out. Leave the house, get 
into King, and sail S to (5,2).

This is Ice Ring Isle, the giant iceberg where we got the iron boots. Not too 
much to do here. Get your map (the island is SW of center). Kill the boat 
patrolling the island. Now, with the help of treasure map #17, pull up a chest 
with 200 rupees inside. Sail S to (5,1).

This is a pair of small islands, the Angular Isles, and they're located S of 
center. Get your map, then use treasure map #15 to find a piece of heart. Sail 
to the islands, though you can't exactly "land." There's a block puzzle on each 
island, start with the bigger one. Run around to the side opposite of where you 
start, and you'll see a discolored block in the wall. Pull it out one step. 
That's the trick with these puzzles, knowing when to pull things out all the way 
or just partially. Anyway, that's enough for you to climb on it and then up to 
the next ledge. Go around to the other side and push the block off the ledge. 
Drop down to it and pull it as far as it can go (in the direction you were 
pushing earlier). Now climb on it and up to the ledge you can reach. Pull the 
block you can out one step and you can climb up to the very top for a piece of 
heart. Get in King and sail near the small island. Use the hookshot on the tree 
to get up and drop into the hole. There is a column of blocks here, with one 
pushable block on the floor (on the left side). Pull that around to the right 
side, so it is exactly opposite of where it was before. Hop on top and you can 
pull a block out one step. Now hop down and you can pull the bottom block back 
one step. Get back up and pull this block one more step. The column will drop by 
one. Get on top of the second box and climb up, pulling things out at one step 
intervals as needed. You'll eventually make it to the top with two spotlights 
shining at you. Use them and your mirror shield to create a chest in the niche 
opposite where you first entered this place (the trick is that you can't shine 
directly on it, you have to be facing to the left or right and then aim your 
shield back at it). Use the leaf to get to it and open it for 200 rupees. You 
can leave here now. Sail E to (6,1).

We're looking for NW of center here. Get your map and use treasure map #32 for a 
map of treasure maps that give you hearts (there are 11 total, 5 of which alone 
are found on Windfall Island). The island is a game, the Boating Course; 
basically, you pilot your boat around an obstacle course gathering rupees. So 
far that's the only purpose I know of, but it's a good way to make easy money. 
I've gotten over 100 without even trying, which, given the price of 30 rupees, 
is a good deal. Take note of this place, you might need it later. Once you're 
done playing, get into King and sail over to the other side. Use your hookshot 
to get up top where you can find a hole. Drop in. Now, if you can, ignore the 
imps. What you really want to do is hit the three switches with the boomerang 
(luckily, it can be one at a time). That will create a chest with a map of the 
submarines inside. Leave (you can't kill the imps, they spawn infinitely) and 
get back to King. Sail N to (6,2).

Forest Haven. It's just E of center. Get your map, use treasure map #31 for 
another heart piece, then land. Work your way back up to the giant tree and use 
the floor pods to work your way up to where you got the leaf. Right across from 
you is another pod. Use the leaf to reach it, then shoot up to the ledge there 
(where you leave to get to the Gallery). There is another floor pod here you can 
use (with the leaf) to get all the way to the other side of this huge room (you 
need to stop on the tree branch in the middle). Go into the door there. Set the 
wind SE and float to the little island that you see as you enter. The chest has 
treasure map #3. Now float from here back to where King is and then sail N to 
(6,3).

The island is NE of center. Get your map, then use treasure map #20 to get a 
piece of heart (four again, only 8 pieces left). Land on the Bomb Island (it 
looks like a bomb) and get rid of the boulder at the top (why waste bombs, pick 
it up and chuck it) to open a hole. Drop in and use magtails on the switches to 
get to a chest (in the second room, you need to step on a switch over to the 
left first). Inside is a piece of heart. 

Time for a little mini-quest action. There is another trading guy on this 
island, which, with the ones on the Mother & Child Isles and back at Greatfish 
Isle, makes three. We're going to start a huge trade between them. To get to 
Greatfish Isle, you can teleport directly there. For the Mother & Child Isles, 
teleport to (3,5) (Tingle Island) and sail NW to get there. To get back here, 
teleport to Forest Haven (6,2) and sail N. You shouldn't have to change the wind 
at all. Okay, you have a pinwheel in your inventory. Do the following.

1) Trade it to the guy on Bomb Island for a Sickle Moon Flag (cost: 40 rupees)
2) Trade that to the Greatfish Isle guy for a Fountain Idol (cost: 65 rupees)
3) Bring it to the guy on the M&C Isles for a Big Sale Flag (cost: 35 rupees)
4) Back to Bomb Island. Give it to the guy for a Hero's Flag (cost: 75 rupees, 
   because our FLAG has some cracks in it... I think this guy knows a lot about 
   crack alright)
5) The Greatfish Isle guy will trade you a Postman Statue (cost: 100 rupees)
6) Go to the M&C Isles to trade for a Shop Guru Statue (cost: 200 rupees)
7) Give it to the Greatfish Isle guy and he will reward you with a piece of 
   heart (priceless)

After that, teleport to (5,4). Sail E to (6,4).

The third pearl island, Eastern Triangle Island, is here, located dead center. 
Get your map, use treasure map #34 to get 200 rupees, and then just sail N to 
(6,5).

NW of center is the volcano we got our power bracelets from, Fire Island. First, 
get your map. Now, use the map and treasure map #37 to get yourself 200 rupees. 
Sail or teleport N to (6,6).

Dragon Roost Island. Treasure map #39's booty is here, 200 rupees. Get it and 
land on the island. Go into the bird town and talk to the guar outside the room 
you first met Medli in. He'll say something about golden feathers. Give him 20 
and he will reward you with a 100 rupee piece. Go back outside and fast-forward 
a day. You'll have a letter from his girlfriend with a heart piece in it. Score! 
Continue N to (6,7).

This square has a lot to do, but not on the island. Islands, actually. The 
Seven-star Isles are NE of center. Get your map. Slightly SE of center, there 
are three watchtowers. No turrets this time, lucky us. Hookshot up to the middle 
one, and kill the wizzrobe there. That will create a chest with 20 rupees in it. 
Another wizzrobe will attack you. Kill him to create a chest on the northernmost 
tower. Two more wizzrobes will attack. Dispatch them to create a chest on the 
southern tower. Jump to the other towers to collect your booty, a golden feather 
and treasure map #16, respectively. Go E to (7,7).

Dead center is where you'll find Overlook Island. Get your map. Treasure map #13 
will help you get a map of all the holes you can jump into. Get near the island 
(kill the boat if you wish) and use the hookshot to get up onto the black 
pillar. Hookshot your way from pillar to pillar until you reach the one with the 
hole. Drop in. It's another one of these places, the kind where you clear each 
room. From the one directly to your left as you enter the main room, going 
clockwise: 3 Armos knights, 2 stalfos knights, bar door, 2 wizzrobes (the kind 
that summons enemies), 5 bokoblins (with shield, inside the pots). When they're 
all cleared, you have to fight FOUR darknuts in the main room. The best I can 
offer is try to get the chest plate off of one and use fire arrows on him until 
he dies. Fighting 4 darknuts is going to be tough no matter how you slice it. 
Kill them to open the bar door. Inside is another blue emblem. Play the Wind's 
Requiem on it to get a Triforce map (#8). Leave. Get into King and go S to 
(7,6).

Our next island is located dead center as well. Get your map and then treasure 
map #19's treasure, a map of the heart pieces on land. Land on the Flight 
Control Platform where we can play a little game. Talk to the first bird who 
will charge you 10 rupees to play. Your goal is to jump off the dock and, using 
the tornados and the wind (set it NW), glide to the end. This is a LOT tougher 
than it seems, namely because your magic runs out before the end, usually. So, 
you need cracker-jack timing and reflexes to make it. OR, you need a GBA and 
connector cable. See, you can use Tingle to refill your magic as you go (use 
blue potions, 80 rupees a pop, but full refill). That's what I have to do. But 
if you can make it legitimately, more power to you. You get a heart piece for 
doing it (which makes 4 again, huzzah!). After you win, you can leave (the prize 
for doing it twice is only 50 rupees). S of center is a sub. Inside is all dark 
until you step on a switch in the floor. Then wizzrobes, chuchus, and imps 
attack you. Kill them all to get a chest with a map in it (of the various 
watchtowers). Sail S to (7,5).

This place (Star Belt Archipelago) is pretty stupid. The island is W of center. 
Get your map, then find a 200 rupee piece with treasure map #27. Sail S to 
(7,4).

The last fairy island (Thorn Fairy Island) is here. It is SE of center. Get your 
map and use it to get the treasure from map #5, a piece of heart. Sail S to 
(7,3).

Dead center is where we're going. Get your map, then get treasure map #36's 
booty, 200 rupees. We should be loaded by now. Land on Bird's Peak Rock. The 
puzzle here is virtually the same as the one at (1,3). You need to hit all the 
switches with a seagull while dodging the enemy birds. Try to pick them off with 
arrows before you even start. You should have 2 pears or 3 pairs, so, if you 
want, you can call a gull, get all the birds behind you, and lure them down to 
Link for easy killing. Once all the switches are hit, a gate will open, leading 
to a hole. Drop down. This one's easy; just stand on the blue emblem for your 
Triforce map (#3). That's all of them. Go back to King and sail S to (7,2).

The islands, the Cliff Plateau Isles, are NW. Get your map, then land. Work your 
way around to the hole and go in. This place looks a lot more complicated than 
it is. Just start with the platform on your left and work your way around. Get 
to the other side, and work through the maze of tentacles. At the end is a giant 
plant that, when you kill it, turns into a baba bud. Use it to get up. Across 
from you, you can see a boarded up place. Burn them with fire arrows. Before you 
go across, though, drop to the chest below you. When you open it (it's a joy 
pendant), a lot of the tentacles will disappear (not all, though). Now get back 
up and glide over to where you opened. Step into the light to be teleported to 
the top. Open the chest here for a treasure map (#25). Get back to King and sail 
S to (7,1).

The LAST square! FINALLY! And it's one of the crappy archipelagos, no less! 
You'll find the Five-star Isles NE of center. Get your very last map. Kill the 
birds and boats around the island. Use treasure map #33 to pull up a piece of 
heart. Lastly, go SE of center and find a sub. Inside are some moblins and 
keese. Kill them to get a chest with a piece of heart in it (one left!). Now you 
can leave and go back to King. Our first world tour is almost over. Teleport to 
(6,2).

Now, during your travels, you probably noticed some koroks standing next to 
pretty pathetic looking trees. They went off to plant more Deku Trees, but 
without the water from Forest Haven to nourish them, they won't grow. Your 
mission: get water to the trees.

This is trickier than it sounds, because you only have 20 minutes to get to all 
8 trees. After that, the forest water becomes regular water. Read ahead to see 
what you have to do, then go to it. Don't dilly-dally or try to get treasures we 
haven't gotten yet. I have no plans on skipping anything, be patient. Also, you 
can check how much time you have left by going to the water in the menu and 
hitting A. Let's go.

1) Land on Forest Haven. Set the wind E (why waste time doing it when we're on 
   the clock?) and go up to the Deku Tree. Inside his little room, fill a 
   bottle with water (you need to be in the "stream" part, not the "pond" at 
   his base, because you need to be deep enough). Run back out to King and sail 
   E to (7,2).
2) We were just here. Get back up to the chest you got map #25 from (you need 
   to go through the hole again). The tree is up there. Pour water on it and 
   hop back to King. Teleport to (2,4).
3) Get to the little hill you jumped from for a heart piece earlier (reset the 
   wind so you go faster). Up on top is the second tree. Water it, get back to 
   King, and sail SW to (1,3).
4) Land on the island and water the tree (it's back by where a chest was on 
   fire earlier. Get back to King and teleport to (4,2).
5) Sail W to (3,2). The tree is back near the iron boot switch. Teleport to 
   (5,4).
6) Sail S to (5,3). The tree is on the side of the pool opposite your house. 
   Teleport back to (5,4).
7) Now sail N to (5,5). Water the tree on the island and teleport to (3,5).
8) Sail NW to (2,6). The tree is on the little island, near the trader. Sail N 
   to (2,7).
9) The last tree is here. Water it and watch the magic.

After you water the last tree, they will all grow and a heart piece will fall. 
That's the last one! Let's go get us some Triforce. Teleport to (3,5).
