V) LINK'S WORLD TOUR #2: TREASURE AND TRIFORCE
---------------------------------------------------------------

Let's do this. Teleport to (2,4).

Use Triforce map #1 to pull up your first piece of Triforce. Sail SW to (1,3). 
Here, use treasure map #28 to get 200 rupees. Teleport back to (2,4).

Now, you want to go NW to (1,5). Use treasure map #8 here to get 200 rupees. 
Land on the island and drop into the hole for another fairy (to put in the 
bottle you used for the Deku Tree quest). Go N to (1,6).

You don't need to clear the reef, but it makes things a lot easier. It's up to 
you. Either way, treasure map #41 will give you a map of the great fairies 
(useless to us now). Go N again to (1,7).

Treasure map #25 will give you 200 rupees here. Teleport to (2,1).

Use Triforce map #4 to get another shard. Then you want to sail W to (1,1).

Treasure map #9 is the guest of honor here. Use it to get 200 rupees, then 
teleport back to (2,1).

Now you want to sail NE to (3,2). The prize there, 200 rupees, is gotten with 
treasure map #16. Sail S to (3,1).

Treasure map #40 will give you ANOTHER 200 rupees. Hey big spender. Dig this 
blender. Sail E to (4,1).

Another reef. Clear it if you want, but make sure you use Triforce map #8 to get 
a piece of the Triforce here. Teleport to (5,4).

Sail SW to get to (4,3). Triforce map #6 comes in handy in getting you another 
shard. Sail W to (3,3).

Two squares adjacent to each other with Triforce. Triforce map #3 gives you this 
piece. Teleport back to (5,4).

Sail N now to (5,5). Treasure map #3 will give you 200 more rupees (and marks 
the end of the treasure maps). Teleport to (4,6).

Sail N to (4,7). Triforce map #2 gives you a piece here. Teleport to (6,6).

Sail N here too, and you'll be at (6,7). This place is more useful now. Triforce 
map #7 gives you a piece here. Teleport to (6,2).

Sail E and use Triforce map #5 to get the very last piece. The golden triangle 
will assemble and you will be taken to the Quest Screen to see the Triforce of 
Courage in all its glory.

We're about to enter the last dungeon. Make sure your bottles are completely 
full (Granny's soup and 3 fairies) and that you have 99 bombs and arrows. When 
you're ready, teleport to (5,4).
