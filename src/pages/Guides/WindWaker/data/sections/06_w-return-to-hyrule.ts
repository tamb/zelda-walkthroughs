W) RETURN TO HYRULE
---------------------------------------------------------------

Sail into the "courtyard" of the Tower to start a scene. I LOVE this music. All 
the Zelda 1 remixes are awesome. Anyway, back to the game: the Triforce of 
Courage opens up the gate back to Hyrule Castle. You and King go through. Hop 
off and enter the castle. Head down to where you got the Master Sword (and left 
Zelda). That smashed Link statue can't be a good omen. Zelda is waiting for 
you... Or is she? What the heck? A TRAP! Flames come up and two darknuts attack 
you. Two? Please. We've taken on four of their brethren at once. The only trick 
is that you need to burn their capes off with a fire arrow, but you can hit them 
anywhere on their bodies to do that (because the flames engulf them). Take them 
to school. After they die, so do the flames. Head back upstairs to the main 
hall.

Now, there are two doors here, and we've only ever taken one. The time has come 
to take the other (which ends up being right in front of you, actually, because 
there is a very short scene as you enter the hall). Walk straight down this 
bridge to start another scene. Link, using the fully charged Master Sword, 
breaks the seal around the castle. Keep going. This is all straightforward. 
You'll encounter some peahats, red chuchus, moblins, and a darknut. After the 
knight is an area you need to hookshot across (and after the first gap there are 
2 keese that attack). Head into the cave here and enter Ganon's Tower (complete 
with more remixed Zelda 1 music!).
