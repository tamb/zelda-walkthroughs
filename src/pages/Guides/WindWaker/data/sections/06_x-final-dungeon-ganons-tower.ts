X) FINAL DUNGEON: GANON'S TOWER
---------------------------------------------------------------

This first room serves no purpose other than to be forbidding. Go through the 
door to the next room.

This is the main chamber, and it's a lot like those places we've been in before, 
the ones where you have to clear rooms to light torches. No torches here, 
though. Just like those rooms, I take this place clockwise, starting to the 
left. Each door leads to an area reminiscent of a dungeon we've already been 
through. Like I said, we'll start with the one to our left, which coincidentally 
happens to be the room based on the first dungeon. As you get to the door, be 
careful not to cut the rope bridge while fighting the bokoblin. Anyway, go 
inside.

You see a series of spiked poled you can grapple on, some red bubbles, and some 
lava geysers. Ignore the bubbles and grapple your way to the first platform 
floating in the lava. Quickly attach to the next pole and swing to the next 
platform (DON'T hold up as you swing or you will overshoot it). As you land, 
turn right and shoot a fire arrow at the lava where the geyser appears (wait for 
it to be down, though). That will create a platform you should quickly jump 
onto. The geyser will shoot you up in the air. Use the leaf to float to the 
ledge. Kill the bubbles if you wish and then enter the door.

Ah, black and white. It's like the Wizard of Oz in reverse. And look who came to 
join us! Our old pal Gohma. We're stronger, but he's not, so he's a piece of 
cake. Kill him the same way as before. The only thing you need to realize is 
that your equipment has been cleared, so you need to re-equip the grappling 
hook. Also of note, none of your other dungeon spoils are available for use. 
When you win, you'll be teleported to the main chamber.

Re-equip things, smash the skulls for refills, and then go into the next door 
(remember, we're going clockwise).

Welcome to the wood level. There is a switch to your left, activate it with your 
leaf to get a gondola. Hop on, then blow your way across. Well, as far across as 
this gondola goes. Hop over to the moving platform (it needs to be down for you 
to make it). While it is in the down position, there is another wind switch you 
can activate. Do so. Go go Gadget Gondola! You need to float to reach it, and 
then blow this gondola back, too. Float to the right moving platform (the one 
that moves between low and middle). Wait for it to go up, then jump across to 
the other moving platform. Now wait for this one to go up, then float to the 
ledge with the door. Kill the peahats and go through.

Again, a boss revisited in greyscale. And, again, you're limited to what you had 
by the time you cleared this dungeon. Kill him the same way as before to be 
teleported back to the main chamber.

Two down, two to go. Restock, re-equip, and enter the next door.

Earth dungeon. I HATE this room. But, alas, we have no choice. Slowly work your 
way through, taking one coffin at a time. Go up some stairs (taking notice of 
the light and the switch you pass), then do the same thing. Eventually a poe and 
a black chuchu will show up. Go back to the light and use it to freeze the 
chuchu and kill the poe. Pick up the chuchu and put him on the switch. Go stand 
back in the light and wait for him to "thaw." Freeze him again, put him back on 
the switch, and run to the end of the hall and up the stairs, ignoring anything 
that might attack you. Rolling is faster, so roll all you can. If you don't make 
it, go refreeze the chuchu and try again until you do. Up the stairs, you have 
to do the same thing, except the light is nowhere near the switch. Keep the 
chuchus as close to the switch as you can, then shine the light down the hall. 
Run back, put one on the switch, then run back and up the stairs. Tough, yes. 
But not impossible. I suggest killing all but one or two of the chuchus (and 
that stupid stalfos at the end) before even tryinng. When you make it up those 
stairs, go inside the door.

Jalhalla, piece of cake. Have fun. You'll be taken to the main chamber again.

One door left, so after you've grabbed refills and re-equipped, go through.

The wind dungeon. Luckily, this is the easiest room of all. First, kill the 
wizzrobe with a fire arrow. Now, hop on the spring and shoot yourself up in the 
air. Move forward and either right or left, then use the leaf so that you glide 
over the spikes and through the gate. As you land, hop on this spring. Shoot up 
and forward, then glide over the first trap, in between the tornados, then over 
the second trap. When you land, two moblins will come out of jars to attack you. 
Big whoop. Kill them, then use the hookshot to get up to the ledge. Into the 
door we go.

Kill Molgera and get yourself teleported back to the main chamber.

Like those rooms before, the bar door is now open. Equip yourself, save, and 
enter.

Run up the stairs. Imps will come at you, kill them if you wish. Enter the door 
at the top.

This is a wide-open room. There are doors to the right and left and a brick wall 
in front of you. Go into the right door first.

As you enter, you'll be given a sort of code. Remember the order the candles are 
shown to you. Go back through the door and into the door that was on the left 
(which is now right in front of you).

In case you forgot, the order is shown to you again. Now take out your boomerang 
and target the switches in that order. King will appear. This is your way out, 
if need be. You shouldn't need it, though. Go back to the room with the candles.

There is a pit here, and you're going to jump into it, but WAIT. When you land, 
you will be attacked by the same boss you won the hammer from. You can fight him 
if you wish, but I strongly urge against it. This is a maze, and if you fight, 
you will become disoriented (rendering my directions useless). So, DO NOT FIGHT. 
Ignore him completely. With that preface, jump into the pit.

From where you land, go into the door directly behind you. Now, go through doors 
in the following order: left, straight ahead, left, right, straight ahead. As 
you go through them correctly, you will get the classic Zelda chime. Get to the 
end and it will be a different room. Bars will appear behind you, and that boss 
will show up. You have no choice this time, kill him. He likes to make six of 
himself this time and surround you. Roll out of the way of their attack. Five 
will disappear, attack the one that is left. He disappears too, so be quick 
about it. That's the easiest way to kill him. Get the chest: light arrows. AWW 
YEAH! You don't understand yet. You will. Go into the door that opens and you'll 
be teleported back to the room with a brick wall and 3 doors.

That stupid thing will attack again. Let's see how he likes light arrows. One 
shot, he goes down. Nice, eh? Grab the sword he drops and throw it at the brick 
wall. No more brick wall. Enter the new door.

Go up the stairs. Enemies will meet you at each landing: a moblin, a darknut, 2 
moblins, and 2 darknuts. Kill them all with light arrows (one shot kills any 
non-boss, you don't even need to take the armor off the darknuts). When they are 
all dead, the door at the top will open. Go back and claim anything they dropped 
to refill your hearts, arrows, and magic. SAVE. Then go through the door.

Zelda is sleeping in a bed, and Ganondorf is kneeling by her side. He says a 
lot, then summons a huge monster! Actually he calls on a marionette of his 
alter-ego, Ganon. Boss time. Depending on how you look at it, this is one boss 
with three forms, or three bosses. Either way, there are three battles to be 
fought here with no break in between.

                        BOSS: Three-form shadow thing

The first is the puppet. He is really easy. Just keep moving and his lumbering 
swings will miss you. You want to cut the strings (you need to hit each twice) 
with the boomerang. Easy enough. When he is down, get behind him and shoot the 
blue orb on his tail with a light arrow. He'll raise up and regenerate his 
strings. Repeat. Three arrows and we move on.

Now he turns into a spider. Pig puppet to spider, doesn't make sense to me. Oh 
well. This is simple. He raises up, then drops down with his legs flailed out. 
Just look up and make sure you are on the same side as the blue ball when he 
lands. 3 more arrows to bring up the third phase.

Moldorm. I HATE this stupid thing. In Zelda 1, he was just another enemy you met 
in Death Mountain. No big deal. But in Link to the Past, he became the most 
annoying thing ever. His annoyingness carried over to this game too, plus some 
extra difficulty. Ideally, you hit him in the head with the sword, then shoot 
the tail with the light arrows. Sadly, the time he is stunned is so short, it is 
almost impossible. Instead, you can try and take out the ball from a distance, 
just trusting your skill with the bow. That isn't a breeze either. If you run 
out of magic, kill the little spiky guys for refills. Do not be afraid to use 
soup or even fairies here. Eventually you will kill him.

Ganondorf appears at the top of the room with Zelda. He floats away, leaving us 
to chase him. Climb up the rope in the center of the room (you need to use the 
little raised platform to jump onto it, then hold R to climb) and you will be on 
a chandelier very high up. Be careful on these platforms. We're in no hurry. 
Look up and around and you'll see a pole you can grapple onto. Do so and climb 
up to the top. In the center of this area are jars with refills. Collect them, 
then look up for another grapple pole. Hook on and climb up again. In the center 
of this area are some jars, spiky guys, and warp jar. If you need to, burn the 
lid off the warp jar to be taken back down where you can climb up and recollect 
everything. Repeat until fully stocked. If you look along the outer wall, there 
is a blue door. Hookshot up to it and walk through for the final battle.
