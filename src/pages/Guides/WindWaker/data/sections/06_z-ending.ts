As if I would ruin the ending. Not a chance. Once the credits roll and 
everything is said and done, the game will ask you if you want to save a special 
game slot. If you do, the next game you start will have some differences. Link 
will be in his pajamas, for one thing. It's up to you. If you want to complete 
the Nintendo Gallery, you have to. Congratulations of beating The Legend of 
Zelda: The Wind Waker!
