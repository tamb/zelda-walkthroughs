Pretty much the only way you can reach me is by e-mail. My address is:

                   biffslamkovich@hotmail.com

Put "Zelda FAQ" or something similar in the subject line so I know it's a 
question and not spam. Everything I know about the game is written here, though, 
so unless you're asking for clarification, I won't be much help.

Also, please be patient. I got 80 e-mails yesterday alone. It might take me a 
little while to respond. I read and reply to everything I get, though.
