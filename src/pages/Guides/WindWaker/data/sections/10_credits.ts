===============================================================================

Since the last version, I've had a LOT of people send in contributions. Some of 
the stuff I had already, but I think they deserve thanks anyway for trying to 
help (I don't know what you are comfortable with me crediting you as; I mean, by 
e-mail addy or whatever, so I tried to do my best):

Ray Strife, Jarel Jones, Mike 'hobbit' Macnamara, Pius, Bert, Solo, 
possumwrangler, Samus Aron, Jared, Derrick Miles... (this is incomplete, I'm 
gonna fix it next update because Hotmail is slow as hell today)

I'd also like to thank:

--Nintendo, for making such a great game
--Ephemeral Fantasia, for being bad enough to trade in and get and extra \$2 
towards my Game Cube
--Most importantly, Kelly, for being the best girlfriend ever. And for sending 
the game from Japan.
