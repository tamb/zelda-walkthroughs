5.          Enemies         
===============================================================================

This is a list of the basic, everyday enemies you will face. For the bosses, 
look in their respective dungeons. The spoils lists are to the best of my 
knowledge, but feel free to correct me.

---------------------------------------------------------------
A) LAND/DUNGEON ENEMIES
---------------------------------------------------------------

ARMOS
Description: Small bouncy statue with spikes
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: You need to hit the crystal on the back of the Armos. You can either 
strafe around it until you have an opening, or shoot the "eye" on the front with 
and arrow to stun the Armos and attack then.

ARMOS KNIGHT
Description: Large bouncy statue with spikes
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: Lock on and shoot an arrow into the eye of the statue, then chuck a 
bomb into its open maw.

BLACK CHUCHU
Description: Black blob
Spoils dropped: Random chuchu jellies
Strategy: These are the trickiest of all. You need to get the chuchu to step 
into light (or shine light on them with the mirror shield) to turn them into 
statues. Then you can throw the statues or hit them with the hammer to kill the 
chuchu. Like magtails, they are often used on switches, though.

BLUE BUBBLE
Description: Flying skull covered in blue flames
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: If you get touched by the flames, you can't use any weapons/items 
(much like the bubbles from Zelda 1), so avoid getting hit at all costs. Use 
either the Deku Leaf or an ice arrow to put out the blue fire (the weapons are 
each useful in certain situations). When the flames are out, kill the skull with 
your sword.

BLUE CHUCHU
Description: Blue blob
Spoils dropped: Blue chuchu jellies
Strategy: They are usually electrified, so stun with the boomerang, then attack 
with the sword.

BOKO BABA
Description: Think "Little Shop of Horrors"
Spoils dropped: Baba seeds
Strategy: One blow from a boomerang will kill it. If you don't have the 
boomerang yet, use the grappling hook to stun the plant for a second and wail on 
it with your sword.

BOKOBLIN
Description: The smaller pig-nosed guys
Spoils dropped: Joy pendants
Strategy: No real strategy needed, these guys are a cinch. Just whack them with 
the sword until they die. Use the boomerang to make an easy task even easier.

DARKNUT
Description: Armored knight, kinda looks like a dog underneath
Spoils dropped: Knight's crests
Strategy: Use the parry attack. Always the parry attack. When you have the 
helmet off, you can stun with the boomerang. Run behind and cut the straps 
holding the rest of the armor on. Then use the boomerang attack described above 
in section 4.

FLOOR MASTER
Description: Strange bodiless arm
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: Stun with the boomerang, then attack. Or use fire arrows. Or, use an 
ice arrow, then a fire arrow while frozen. Just be quick with whatever you 
decide to do, or you'll be sucked back to the beginning of the dungeon (or 
somewhere else that isn't where you were).

GREEN CHUCHU
Description: Green blob
Spoils dropped: Green chuchu jellies
Strategy: Hit them with the sword. That's it. The boomerang stuns them.

KARGAROC
Description: Multi-colored bird (also found on the sea)
Spoils dropped: Golden feathers
Strategy: Use the sword. Or two hits with the boomerang. Or one arrow. Or a 
bomb. Or... These guys are easy, go away.

KEESE
Description: Bats
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: Boomerang, grappling hook, sword, arrow... Also very easy. They come 
on fire sometimes. If you get hit, roll on the ground to put out the flames.

MAGTAIL
Description: Giant centipede
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: To kill, use the parry attack. More often, though, you want them alive 
(but in ball form). In that case, throw a jar of water at them, or hit them with 
the sword/boomerang. But NOT the parry attack.

MINIBLIN ("Imp")
Description: Little, well, imp guys
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: Sword, boomerang, arrows... They're easy; they just like to swarm you.

MOBLIN
Description: The big pig-nosed guys
Spoils dropped: Skull necklaces
Strategy: Use the parry attack or just the sword. The boomerang makes these guys 
a lot easier. They're not all that tough anyway, though.

MORTH ("Spiny/spiky guys")
Description: Little balls of spines with an eye
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: They don't do damage, just slow you down. A spin attack will clear 
them off of you and often kill them. The boomerang kills them too.

MOTHULA
Description: Giant bug
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: Fire arrows kill them in one hit. The boomerang is nice too, or the 
parry attack. They fly sometimes too. Just cut off the wings and they're regular 
mothulas.

OCTOROK
Description: Giant octopus (also found on the sea)
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: You can't use your sword on them (they won't let you get close 
enough), but any projectile weapon works. Or, just use your shield to reflect 
the rocks they shoot at you.

PEAHAT
Description: Whirly flying plant guys
Spoils dropped: Golden feathers
Strategy: Use the Deku Leaf or the boomerang to force them to land, then kill 
them with the sword. Easy.

POE
Description: Translucent ghost with lantern.
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: You can't attack them until they are solid. Make them that way by 
either shining light on them with the mirror shield or getting them to follow 
you into light elsewhere. Once solid, they are susceptible to the boomerang 
attack above or fire arrows. OR, you can just wait for them to possess you 
(while translucent, but after they drop the lanterns) and they'll be effectively 
dead.

RE-DEAD
Description: Zombie with hoop earrings
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: Wail on them with the sword. You can freeze them for a few seconds by 
shining light on them.

RED BUBBLE
Description: Flying skull covered in red flames
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: You can use the Deku Leaf to put out the flames, but why? Just hit 
them with an arrow (a regular one) or the sword.

RED CHUCHU
Description: Red blob
Spoils dropped: Red chuchu jellies
Strategy: 

STALFOS KNIGHT
Description: Giant skeleton
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: First, you need to blow them apart with a bomb. When the pieces of the 
skeleton are on the ground, attack the skull with your sword or the hammer.

WIZZROBE
Description: Flying wizard
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: If they are low enough, use the sword. It's generally easier to use 
fire/ice arrows, though.

YELLOW CHUCHU
Description: Yellow blob
Spoils dropped: Green/red chuchu jellies
Strategy: Same as the blue chuchu. Stun with the boomerang, then attack with the 
sword.

---------------------------------------------------------------
B) SEA ENEMIES
---------------------------------------------------------------

BIG OCTO ("Squids")
Description: Giant squids with 4, 8, or 12 eyes
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: Take out the eyes with the boomerang. It takes three hits per eye.

GYORG
Description: Shark
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: Hit them two times with the boomerang. Easy.

SEAHAT
Description: Giant turnip helicopter things
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: Hit them twice with the boomerang. These guys are easy, but VERY 
annoying.

WARSHIP
Description: Pirate ships
Spoils dropped: None
Strategy: Three cannonball hits. Try to get in close, they are easier at point-
blank range.
