O) IRON BOOTS AND ICE ISLAND
---------------------------------------------------------------

Set the wind E and sail to (5,2). SW of center is another island. This is an 
iceberg with a dragon's head (stone) spewing frost. Shooting a fire arrow 
through the frost will do wonders (and start another 5 minute timer). Hop off 
King and onto the shore. There is a chest here encased in ice. Shoot it with a 
fire arrow and open it for a treasure map (#36). Run around until you can climb 
up onto the ledge, and then run around the ledge until you can jump to the 
platforms in the water. Ice is slippery, so you may find crawling easier on the 
narrower parts. I do. Jump across the three platforms to the dragon's head and 
go in. Go across the ledge to your right (the icy one), kill the keese, and keep 
going. Slide down the little slide (don't go off the side) and open the chest. 
That'll stop the timer and give you iron boots. Equip them and use them to put 
them on. Walk around the non-icy ledge. When you get to the point with the wind, 
turn right and drop into the hole. It's a little hard to see here. Use fire 
arrows to thaw out the moblins (there are 2), bokoblins (2 of those also) and a 
darknut (don't thaw them all out at once!). After killing them all, a chest will 
appear with 100 rupees. The light will teleport you back outside. Get to King.
