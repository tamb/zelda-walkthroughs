R) MAKAR LENDS A HAND
---------------------------------------------------------------

The second sword dungeon starts a lot like the first. Teleport to (4,6) and sail 
N to (4,7) and an island there. Land and put on the iron boots. Walk through the 
wind and smack the weird boulder there with the hammer. Go inside the cave. 
Examine the tablet, then play your Wind Waker. The song is Up, Up, Down, Right, 
Left, Right. A weird boy will talk to you. He needs you to find someone with a 
fiddle. That fiddle looks a lot like the koroks. Hmm... Go back to King and 
teleport to (6,2). You'll be right at the island, so land. I had mail, a letter 
that cost 10 rupees, but gave me 20. Climb up the ledges and go left at the 
first fork. In the right waterfall, you can see musical notes. Hmm... Go back 
and take the right fork this time. Continue up to the first grapple point. 
Attach, but don't swing across. Instead, use R to climb down as far as you can, 
then swing into the right waterfall. You'll be in a little cave. Climb down the 
ladder and talk to Makar. Play your new song and there will be a little jam 
session. The leaf agrees to come with you. You're automatically back in King, so 
get baack to the island (follow the directions at the beginning of the 
paragraph).

Again, you'll automatically land, and, also again, you'll want to walk up to the 
tablet and play the song. Makar will play too, and the tablet will shatter.
