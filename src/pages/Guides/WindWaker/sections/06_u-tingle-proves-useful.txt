U) TINGLE PROVES USEFUL
---------------------------------------------------------------

Start by pulling up the treasure from map #10 (200 rupees). Now land on the 
island. You should have a LOT of money saved up. We need at least 2800 rupees 
(well, 2786 to be exact). If you don't have it, you can go back to (6,1) and 
play the game there. Or you could read ahead where I detail how to find more 
rupees with treasure maps. Or go kill a lot of stuff. Whatever. But this 
shouldn't even be an issue. Go up to Tingle and get the remaining 7 Triforce 
maps decoded. I don't mind getting the maps. The fact that I have to pay 3200 
rupees total to use them, that's just plain stupid. And how can Tingle read them 
when we can't? He drew the map to his island with a FREAKING CRAYON! Maybe if 
the fish did it, that would make sense. But Tingle?! Anyway, I'm done griping. 
Time to hit the road again. Luckily, we don't need to go to every square this 
time. Just a lot of them. On the bright side, you won't need to get off of King 
at all (well, almost). We're just getting buried treasure.
